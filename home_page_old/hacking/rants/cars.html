<h1>If programming languages were cars...</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>


<p>This is an update to an old series of jokes about computer languages being
like cars.  I've added some more modern languages to the list.  Any
suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> It seems that Digg/Reddit/StumbleUpon have dug/read/stumbled
upon this page, with the result that I've received a ton of new suggestions.
This is just an illustration of Vanier's Law: <i>"Given enough time, any
programming-related rant, no matter how inane, will eventually be posted on
Reddit/Digg/StumbleUpon etc."</i> Thanks to all who sent me their
suggestions; I've sifted through them and added the ones I liked to the page.
I've also added some suggestions from the comments page on digg.com below,
without permission; if you are the author and object, I'll be happy to remove
it.  If I didn't post your suggestion, please realize that it's not personal;
it's only because I'm an asshole with no sense of humor.</p>

<p>Also, some people speculated on my own preference in languages.  I'm a
functional programming weenie (some would even say a smug one), so my
preferences run roughly like this: Haskell &gt; Ocaml &gt; Scheme/Lisp &gt;
Erlang &gt; Python/Ruby &gt; C.  There are other languages I like
(<i>e.g.</i> Prolog and Smalltalk), but I don't work with them to any
significant degree.  And there are languages I hate, which I won't talk about
here in the interests of avoiding pointless flame wars (by which I mean
people sending me emails telling me "YOU SUCK!").  Also, TCL fans: thanks for
the suggestions, but I didn't find one that seemed funny enough and/or apt
enough to include, so keep trying.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this page has been translated into <a
href="http://www.gorbikoff.com/2009/01/28/if-programming-languages-were-cars/">Russian</a>.
Thanks to Nick Gorbikoff for the translation.  This article has also been
translated into <a href="http://wp.me/pcoPx-xc">Arabic</a>. I don't know the
author's name, but I thank him (or her) too.</p>

<p>Enjoy...</p>

<h2>The list</h2>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Ada</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a tank. A butt-ugly tank that never breaks
down. People laugh uncontrollably if you tell them you drive Ada, but really,
do you want to be driving a sports car in a war zone? [from Amit
Dubey]</p></li>

<li><p><b>Assembly Language</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a bare engine; you have to build
the car yourself and manually supply it with gas while it's running, but if
you're careful it can go like a bat out of hell.</p>

<p>[From "Subterfug" off digg.com:]</p>

<p><b>Assembly Language:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; you are the car.</p>

</li>

<li><p><b>Basic</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a simple car useful for short drives to the
local shops.  Once popular with learner drivers, it has recently been
stripped down to a shell and rebuilt by a major manufacturer, The new version
has been refurbished for longer journeys, leaving only cosmetic similarities
to the original model. [from Przemyslaw Wrzos]</p></li>

<li><p><b>C</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a racing car that goes incredibly fast but
breaks down every fifty miles.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Cobol</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is reputed to be a car, but no self-respecting
driver will ever admit having driven one.</p></li>

<li><p><b>C#</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a competing model of family station wagons.
Once you use this, you're never allowed to use the competitors' products
again.</p></li>

<li><p><b>C++</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a souped-up version of the C racing car with
dozens of extra features that only breaks down every 250 miles, but when it
does, nobody can figure out what went wrong.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Eiffel</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a car that includes a built-in driving
instructor with a French accent.  He will help you quickly identify and learn
from your mistakes, but don't you dare argue with him or he'll insult you and
throw you out of the car. [From Daniel Prager with some
embellishments]</p></li>

<li><p><b>Erlang</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a fleet of cars that all cooperate to get
you where you want to go.  It takes practice to be able to drive with one
foot in each of several cars, but once you learn how you can drive over
terrain that would be very hard to navigate any other way.  In addition,
because you're using so many cars, it doesn't matter if a few of them break
down.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Forth</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a car you build yourself from a kit.  Your
car doesn't have to look or behave like anyone else's car.  However, a Forth
car will only go backwards.</p>

<p>[By "256byteram", on a comment on Digg.com (I couldn't resist):]</p>

<p>FORTH LOVE IF HONK THEN !</p>

</li>

<li><p><b>Fortran</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a pretty primitive car; it'll go very
quickly as long as you are only going along roads that are perfectly
straight.  It is believed that learning to drive a Fortran car makes it
impossible to learn to drive any other model.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Java</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a family station wagon.  It's easy to drive,
it's not too fast, and you can't hurt yourself.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Haskell</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is an incredibly elegantly-designed and
beautiful car, which is rumored to be able to drive over extremely strange
terrain.  The one time you tried to drive it, it didn't actually drive along
the road; instead, it made copies of itself and the road, with each
successive copy of the road having the car a little further along.  It's
supposed to be possible to drive it in a more conventional way, but you don't
know enough math to figure out how.</p>

[Monadic version:] <p><b>Haskell</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is not really a car; it's an
abstract machine in which you give a detailed description of what the process
of driving would be like if you were to do it.  You have to put the abstract
machine inside another (concrete) machine in order to actually do any
driving.  You're not supposed to ask how the concrete machine works.  There
is also a way to take multiple abstract machines and make a single abstract
machine, which you can then give to the concrete machine to make multiple
trips one after another.</p>

</li>

<li><p><b>Lisp</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>looks</u> like a car, but with enough
tweaking you can turn it into a pretty effective airplane or
submarine.</p>

<p>[from Paul Tanimoto:]</p>

<p><b>Lisp</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp; At first it doesn't seem to be a car at all, but
now and then you spot a few people driving it around.  After a point you
decide to learn more about it and you realize it's actually a car that can
make more cars.  You tell your friends, but they all laugh and say these cars
look way too weird.  You still keep one in your garage, hoping one day they
will take over the streets.</p>

</li>

<li><p><b>Mathematica</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a well-designed car that borrowed a
lot from the Lisp car without giving it nearly the credit it deserved.  It
can solve equations to determine the most efficient way to get to the
destination, but it costs a fortune</p></li>

<li><p><b>Matlab</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a car designed for novice drivers going on
short trips over terrain similar to the terrain the Mathematica car is
usually driven over.  It is very comfortable when driving over this terrain,
but if you go off the trail even a little the car becomes so hard to drive
that more snobby drivers refuse to even acknowledge that it's a car.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Ocaml</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a very sexy European car. It's not quite as
fast as <b>C</b>, but it never breaks down, so you end up going further in
less time.  However, because it's French, none of the controls are in the
usual places.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Perl</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is supposed to be a pretty cool car, but the
driver's manual is incomprehensible.  Also, even if you can figure out how to
drive a Perl car, you won't be able to drive anyone else's.</p></li>

<li><p><b>PHP</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, it's bizarre and
hard to handle but everybody still wants to drive it. [from "CosmicJustice"
off of digg.com]</p></li>

<li><p><b>Prolog</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is fully automatic: you tell it what your
destination looks like, and it does all the driving for you.  [Addendum from
Paul Graham:] However, the effort required to specify most destinations is
equivalent to the effort of driving there.</p>

<p>[I forget who suggested this one:]</p>

<p><b>Prolog</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a car with a unique trial-and-error GPS
system.  It will go down the road looking for your destination, and if it
gets to the end of the street without finding it, it will back up and try the
next street over and continue until you get where you need to go.</p>

</li>

<li><p><b>Python</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a great beginner's car; you can drive it
without a license.  Unless you want to drive really fast or on really
treacherous terrain, you may never need another car.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Ruby</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a car that was formed when the Perl, Python
and Smalltalk cars were involved in a three-way collision.  A Japanese
mechanic found the pieces and put together a car which many drivers think is
better than the sum of the parts.  Other drivers, however, grumble that a lot
of the controls of the Ruby car have been duplicated or triplicated, with
some of the duplicate controls doing slightly different things in odd
circumstances, making the car harder to drive than it ought to be.  A
redesign is rumored to be in the works.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Smalltalk</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a small car originally designed for
people who were just learning to drive, but it was designed so well that even
experienced drivers enjoy riding in it.  It doesn't drive very fast, but you
can take apart any part of it and change it to make it more like what you
wanted it to be.  One oddity is that you don't actually drive it; you send it
a message asking it to go somewhere and it either does or tells you that it
didn't understand what you were asking.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Visual Basic</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a car that drives you.  [from
"yivkX360" on digg.com, no doubt channeling Yakov Smirnov]</p></li>
