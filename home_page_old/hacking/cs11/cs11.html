This page contains reference material that may be useful for students of
CS 11 (Software Shop).  The material described here ranges from elementary to
very advanced.

<h1>General interest</h1>

<h2>books</h2>

<ul>

<li> Abelson and Sussman, <u>Structure and Interpretation of 
     Computer Programs</u>

<p>

The "Feynman Lectures" of computer programming.  SICP (as it's known) is an
extremely well-written guide to the fundamental ideas of programming.  It is
very dense; each page requires careful reading.  The authors use the Scheme
language (a dialect of lisp) to introduce programming concepts, and a bias
towards functional programming styles is evident.  Nevertheless, the big
ideas are relevant to all programming languages, and in our opinion all
serious programmers should read this book.

<p>

<li> <u>Essentials of Programming Languages, 2nd Ed.</u> by Dan Friedman, 
Mitchell Wand, Christopher Haynes

<p>

This book is the next step up after SICP.  The authors create a series of
programming languages in scheme which instantiate different language design
choices.  Good for advanced programmers with a serious interest in the
implementation of computer languages.

<p>

<li> Steve Macguire, <u>Writing Solid Code</u>

<p>

This book contains a lot of useful information primarily aimed at C
programmers.  Especially useful are the chapters on the use of the assert()
macro and on debugging.

<p>

<li> <u>Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Ed.</u> by Bertrand Meyer

<p>

This book gives an exhaustive analysis of the principles of object-oriented
programming.  Meyer is the author of the Eiffel language, and his
presentation is biased towards that world-view.  However, OOSC contains a lot
of useful information.

<p>

<li> Gamma et. al. <u>Design Patterns</u>

<p>

<u>Design Patterns</u> (also called the gang-of-four book or GOF after its
four authors) describes a number of code patterns often found in
object-oriented code which simplify many common tasks.  The book is slanted
towards C++ programmers, but the principles apply to all OO languages.

<p>
A site with many Prolog links is <a href="">here</a>.
<li> Martin Fowler, <u>Refactoring</u>

<p>

Refactoring refers to the process of rewriting code to improve the design
and/or implementation of some part of a program.  It applies both to
high-level design and to low-level implementation details.  This book is a
good introduction to the concept.  More information is available at the
author's <a href="http://www.refactoring.com">web site</a>.

<p>

<li> Kent Beck, <u>Extreme Programming Explained</u>

<p>

Many different software methodologies exist.  Some of these are so
heavyweight it feels like you need a congressional mandate in order to begin
writing any code.  Extreme Programming (XP) is a much lighter-weight
methodology that is gaining increasing support.  See also the author's <a
href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">web site</a>.

</ul>

<h2>web sites</h2>

<ul>

<li> The <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a> home page.

<p>

GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) is the name of the organization that originated the idea
of free (as in speech, not as in beer) software.  Founded and run by the
always provocative Richard Stallman, GNU represents a philosophy of free
exchange of software for the common good.

<p>

<li> Eric Raymond's <a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings">writings</a>.

<p>

Eric Raymond is a leading open source and Linux advocate (see <a
href="http://www.opensource.org">this site</a> for more on open source and
its relation to free software in the GNU sense).  His writings, especially
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar", are interesting examinations of why open
source development works as well as it does.  He is rather full of himself,
and like most advocates he tends to only see the positive side of his
movement, but his writings are always interesting.

<p>

<li> The <a href="http://catb.org/esr/jargon/">jargon file</a>.

<p>

This is a somewhat Unix-centric collection of computer-related jargon.  Very
amusing when you get tired of doing real work.

<p>

<li><a href="http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming
in Ten Years</a>.

<p>

A useful antidote to the "Teach Yourself &lt;language X&gt; in 21 days/24
hours" books. 

<p>

<li> <a href="http://freeworld.thc.org/root/phun/unmaintain.html">
How to write unmaintainable code</a>.

<p>A must-read for any programmer.  It sounds preposterous, but most programmers
run into code like this sooner or later.  Mainly oriented to C/C++/java
programs.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">Esoteric
Programming Languages</a>.

<p>Think you've seen it all when it comes to programming languages?  This site
will cure you of that misconception.  One particularly interesting language
is <a

<h1>C</h1>

C is a low-level imperative language originally designed for system
programming as a replacement for assembly language.  It has become ubiquitous
both as a language for developing applications as well as a language for
implementing other computer languages.  However, use of C is on the decline
as scripting languages and java are used more frequently.  Nevertheless, a
strong knowledge of C is essential for serious programmers.

<h2>books</h2>

<ul>
<li> Kernighan and Ritchie, <u>The C Programming Language, 2nd Ed.</u>
<p>A concise and complete description of the C language.

<p>

<li> Peter van der Linden, <u>Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets</u>
<p>This book, despite its numerous typos, is one of the few books that
explains what is going on at the machine level during compilation and
execution of a C program.

</ul>

<hr>

<h1>C++</h1>

C++ is an extension of C that supports object-oriented and generic
programming.  It is a comparatively difficult language to learn, for these
reasons:

<ul>
<li> The language is very large and very complex.
<li> There are many subtle pitfalls.
<li> To master C++ you have to learn (at least) two new programming
     paradigms (object-oriented programming and generic programming).
     In particular, learning object-oriented programming requires learning 
     a great deal about design issues.
<li> Most compilers do not support the entire C++ standard at the moment.
<li> Programmers who know C may be tempted to use C idioms even though
     there are better C++ idioms (<i>e.g.</i>using "char *" instead of
     "string" for strings.
</ul>

<p>

However, C++ is a very powerful language which can be used effectively in
cases where performance is critical.

<h2>books</h2>

<ul>

<li> Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo, <u>Accelerated C++</u>

<p>

This book is probably the best overall introduction to C++.  However, it
relies heavily on the standard template library and doesn't get around to
object-oriented programming until comparatively late in the book.

<p>

<li> Stan Lippman, <u>Essential C++</u>

<p>

This book is a concise introduction to the major features of C++.  Useful for
someone who wants to pick up the main features of the language quickly.

<p>

<li> Bjarne Stroustrup, <u>The C++ Programming Language, Special Ed.</u>

<p>

This is the standard reference book by the author of the language.  It will
take you a long time to get through the whole thing.  Covers the entire
language.  Not easy reading.

<p>

<li> Stan Lippman and Josee Lajoie, <u>The C++ Primer</u>

<p>

A good tutorial that also covers the entire language.  Very long.

<p>

<li> Scott Meyers, <u>Effective C++</u> and <u>More Effective C++</u>

<p>

Essential style guides for writing C++.  If you want to avoid C++ pitfalls you
<u>must</u> read these books.  Meyers has also written a book called
<u>Essential STL</u> which I have not read but which comes highly recommended.

<p>

<li> Andrei Alexandrescu, <u>Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design
                           Patterns Applied</u>

<p>

Not for the faint-hearted.  This book explains some of the outer limits of
C++, involving some amazing coding styles made possible by templates.  Will
make your head explode, but very cool.

<p>

<li> Stan Lippman, <u>Inside the C++ Object Model</u>

<p>

This book explains in detail what is going on at the machine level when a C++
program is compiled and run.  Mainly for advanced programmers.

</ul>

<h2>web sites</h2>

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs">Bjarne Stroustrup's home
page</a>.

<p>

Contains a very interesting FAQ on C++.  Don't criticize C++ until you've
read it.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc">
A garbage collector for C and C++</a>.

<p>

Despite the fact that C and C++ are designed for manual memory management
(with all the problems that that entails), it is possible to use automatic
garbage collection as well.  This page describes a freely-available
implementation of a garbage collector which works with C and C++.

<p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h1>java</h1>

Java is a relatively new object-oriented language developed at Sun
Microsystems.  It is simpler than C++ and avoids the most problematic
features of that language.  The java environment is based around a portable
bytecode and bytecode interpretation, which makes it extremely portable.

<h2>books</h2>

<ul>

<li> Gosling et al, <u>The Java Programming Language</u>

<p>

This book explains the entire java language clearly and succinctly.  It does
not discuss the enormous java API, however.

<p>

</ul>

<h2>web sites</h2>

<ul>

<li> The main <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java web page</a> at Sun
Microsystems.

<p> 

This page has links to a variety of Java tutorials.  You can also download
the latest JDK here.

</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Objective CAML (ocaml)</h1>

Objective CAML (ocaml) is a language which provides full support for
functional programming and a strong, polymorphically-typed static type
system.  In practice, this means that the ocaml compiler catches a larger
number of errors at compile time than almost any other language.  The
language features many advanced constructs such as variant records and
built-in pattern matching, as well as an object system.  Ocaml is also
extremely fast, rivalling C speed for most tasks.  Those who have used ocaml
generally find it an extremely pleasant language to work in, despite the
somewhat odd syntax.

<h2>books</h2>

<ul>

<li> Cousineau and Mauny, <u>The Functional Approach to Programming</u>

<p>

This book is, to our knowledge, the only English-language book on Caml.  It
does not use Objective Caml but an earlier dialect called Caml light.
However, the differences are minor.  The book is excellent, but its main
focus is on teaching functional programming rather than Caml programming
<i>per se</i>.

</ul>

<h2>web sites</h2>

<ul>

<li> The <a href="http://www.ocaml.org">ocaml home page</a>.

<h1>scheme and lisp</h1>

Scheme and lisp are languages that feature a parenthesized prefix syntax and
a mostly-functional programming paradigm.  Historically, lisp has mainly been
used for artificial intelligence applications while scheme has mainly been a
language used to teach programming concepts.  Both languages can be used
outside these domains, however.

<h2>books</h2>

<ul>

<li> <u>SICP</u>, as mentioned above.

<p>

<li> <u>Scheme and the Art of Programming</u> by George Springer and Dan
Friedman.

<li> <u>Simply Scheme</u> by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright.

<p>

These last two books are a more gentle introduction to scheme than SICP.

<p>

<li> <u>The Little Schemer</u> and <u>The Seasoned Schemer</u> by Dan
Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.

<p>

These two books are short introductions to scheme written in a
question-and-answer format.  They teach how to think about problems in a
functional/recursive way, and are very useful as a companion to SICP, for
instance.

<p>

<li> <u>ANSI Common Lisp</u> and <u>On Lisp</u>, by Paul Graham.

<p>

These two books describe Common Lisp, which is less elegant than scheme but
more practical for serious programming tasks (and much faster if used
correctly).  <u>ANSI Common Lisp</u> is a very thorough description of the
language, while <u>On Lisp</u> is (among other things) the most complete
introduction to Lisp macros available anywhere.  Lisp macros allow you to
customize lisp syntax to your application, and are one of the amazing
features of lisp.

<p>

</ul>

<h2>web sites</h2>

<ul>

<li> The <a href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/index.html">
scheme home page</a> at MIT.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/documentation">
MIT scheme reference material</a>.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme">PLT scheme</a>.

<p>

Another solid implementation of scheme.  Home of the well-known DrScheme
implementation.  PLT software can be downloaded <a
href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages">here</a>.

<p>

<li> <a
href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-1.html">
Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days</a>.

<p>

A nice tutorial on scheme.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/home.html">
The Internet Scheme Repository</a>.

<p>

Tons of scheme-related stuff.  I especially like the list of <a
href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/doc.publications.html">
publications</a>.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a>

<p>

Probably the best open-source common lisp implementation.

<p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h1>python</h1>

Python is probably the best "scripting language" available today.  Scripting
languages emphasize ease of programming, rapid development, and easy
connection to libraries written in C, C++, and java.  Python also has the
advantages of being object-oriented, extremely readable, cross-platform, and
extremely easy to learn.

<h2>books</h2>

<ul>

<li> <u>Learning Python</u> by Mark Lutz (O'Reilly and Associates)

<p>

A clearly-written tutorial.

<p>

</ul>

<h2>web sites</h2>

<ul> 

<li> The <a href="http://www.python.org">Python home page</a>.

<p>

The main site to look for information on python.

<p>

<li> The <u>comp.lang.python</u> news group.

<p>

<li> The <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> home page.

<p>

Jython is an implementation of python written entirely in java, and providing
easy scripting of java components.

<p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Other interesting languages</h1>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>

<p>

Matlab is far from elegant as a programming environment, but it is an
indispensable tool for most scientists.  The programming language uses
two-dimensional arrays (matrices) as the primary data types, and most
operations can work on both scalars and matrices.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.wolfram.com">Mathematica</a>

<p>

Mathematica is the primary computer algebra system in use today.  Its
programming language borrows heavily from Lisp and many other languages.

<p>

<li> Fortran

<p>

Fortran is an extremely archaic language which survives because of the large
amount of scientific and engineering code written in it.  Some Fortran
compilers can produce extremely efficient code (faster than C in some cases),
and many scientists (unfortunately) do all of their work in Fortran.
Learning to program in Fortran can create bad mental habits that are
extremely difficult to overcome, and those who learn to program in Fortran
first often have great difficulties learning other computer languages.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.csharp-station.com">C#</a>

<p>

C# is a new language from Microsoft, which is being positioned as a
competitor to java.  Despite its source, the language appears to be
well-designed and improves on java in a number of respects.

<p>

<li> Eiffel

<p>

Eiffel is a pure object-oriented language with an advanced assertion system
known as Design by Contract that facilitates the design of correct software,
as well as a number of other features.  The canonical Eiffel site is <a
href="http://www.eiffel.com">here</a>.  A good free Eiffel compiler is the <a
href="http://www.loria.fr/projets/SmallEiffel/index.html">GNU SmallEiffel</a>
compiler.

<p>


<li> <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>

<p>

Haskell is a so-called lazy functional language.  Programs in Haskell do not
use any assignment statements whatsoever.  Reasoning about programs is
particularly easy in Haskell, though the lack of imperative features makes
the language challenging to learn.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html">
Standard ML</a>

<p>

Standard ML is quite similar to ocaml.  It has a nicer syntax but is not as
practical for most uses (and is slower).

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org">Smalltalk</a>

<p>Smalltalk is the earliest of the object-oriented programming languages still
in use today.  It has a small but fanatical following.  Programming in
Smalltalk is quite different from programming in Java or C++.  Smalltalk is
dynamically-typed, and emphasizes interactive development and easy
modifiability.  The language itself is incredibly simple.  <a
href="http://www.squeak.org">Squeak</a> is an interesting recent
implementation of Smalltalk.</p>

<li> Prolog

<p>Prolog is a logic programming language.  In such languages, you program by
describing the problem to be solved rather than by describing a series of steps
to solve it, and the computer figures out how to solve it.  One free
implementation is <a href="http://gprolog.org">GNU prolog</a>.  A site with many
Prolog links is <a
href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/prolog/">here</a>.  Another
interesting logic programming language is <a
href="http://minikanren.org/">miniKanren</a>.  A logic programming language with
static typing is <a
href="http://www.mercurylang.org">Mercury</a>.</p>

<li> <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>

<p>Perl is a scripting language widely used for web development.  As a language,
perl is very powerful but violates nearly every rule of good programming
language design.  Perl code is typically extremely difficult to decipher
after it's written.  We believe that Python is a superior alternative to perl
for almost all tasks for which perl is used.</p>

<li> tcl

<p>

Tcl ("tool command language") is a simple scripting language with a very nice
graphical toolkit called Tk.  Tcl is inferior to python for scripting tasks,
so its use is not recommended.

<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.forth.org">Forth</a>

<p>

Forth is a stack-based threaded interpreted language with an unusual postfix
syntax.  Forth is interesting from a language design standpoint but is quite
cumbersome to use and tends to lead to unreadable code.  Forth is really only
useful in embedded applications.  A good free implementation of Forth is <a
href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth">gforth</a>.

<p>

<li> Dylan

<p>

Dylan is a language which is very similar to scheme or lisp but which has an
infix syntax.  A free implementation is <a
href="http://www.gwydiondylan.org">Gwydion Dylan</a>.

<p>

<li> <a href="http.jsoftware.com">J</a>

<p>

J is a dialect of APL, an array-based programming language which was infamous
for requiring a strange set of characters and which typically resulted in
incredibly short (and incomprehensible) programs.  J uses ascii characters
only, and is more functional than APL, but code written in J is still
basically write-only.
