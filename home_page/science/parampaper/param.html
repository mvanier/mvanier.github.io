<h2>
A Comparative Survey of Automated Parameter-Search Methods for
Compartmental Neural Models
</h2> 

by Michael C. Vanier and James M. Bower
<u>Journal of Computational Neuroscience</u> 7/2, pp. 149-171 (1999)

This paper describes a number of parameter-search algorithms that can be used
to assign parameters to single-neuron models, and compares them with each
other on several models, including very simple one-compartment spiking
models, two passive dendrite models, and a moderately complex model of a
layer II pyramidal cell in piriform (olfactory) cortex.  The paper also makes
specific recommendations about how to use the different methods and which
ones are most suited for which kinds of tasks.  We also make several general
recommendations relating to parameter searching in neural models.  The full
text of the paper can be downloaded <a HREF="param_paper.ps.gz">here</a>.
This is a preprint version, so it looks slightly different from the published
version.  The entire GENESIS parameter searching software package can be
downloaded <a HREF="genesis_param.tar.gz">here</a>.  This contains:

<p>

<li> The most recent version of the GENESIS parameter-searching library.

<li> Documentation (GENESIS .doc files) for all GENESIS objects and
functions included in this library, as well as for parameter searching in
general.

<li> Demo scripts for all five parameter-searching objects.

<li> The source directory for the xplot program (originally written by Matt
Wilson), which is useful for viewing the results of parameter searches.

<p>

All of this will be included in the next release of GENESIS (except maybe
for the xplot program; I don't know about that yet).

<p>

This page also includes links to GENESIS scripts describing the ionic
channels and the morphologies of the models described in the above paper.

<li> <a HREF="model1.channels.g">Channel descriptions for models 1 and
2</a>
<li> <a HREF="model3.p">Morphology of model 3</a>
<li> <a HREF="model4.p">Morphology of model 4</a>
<li> <a HREF="model5.channels.g">Channel descriptions for model 5</a>
<li> <a HREF="model5.p">Morphology description for model 5</a>

If you do use the GENESIS parameter searching software, I'd be interested
in hearing about your experiences with it, both good and bad.  Please <a
