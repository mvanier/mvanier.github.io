<h4><a href="parampaper/param.html">A Comparative Survey of Automated
Parameter-Search Methods for Compartmental Neural Models</a> by Michael
C. Vanier and James M. Bower. <u>Journal of
Computational Neuroscience</u> 7/2, pp. 149-171 (1999)</h4>

<p>
This paper provides an overview of parameter-searching methods for
single-neuron compartmental neural models.  We compare several different
parameter-search methods on a variety of neural models.  The methods
including conjugate-gradient descent, stochastic search, genetic algorithm,
and simulated annealing.  The models include a very simple one-compartment
model with four active conductances, two passive dendritic models, and a
moderately realistic model of a layer 2 pyramidal cell in piriform cortex.
We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the different
methods for the different classes of problems and make specific suggestions
on how to optimally go about the  parameter searching process with neural
models.

<h4><a href="bayespaper/baldi_vanier_bower_1998.tar.Z"> On the use of
Bayesian Methods for Evaluating Compartmental Neural Models</a>, by Pierre
F. Baldi, Michael C. Vanier, and James M. Bower.  <u>Journal of
Computational Neuroscience</u> 5, pp. 285-314 (1998)</h4>

<p>
This paper provides a tutorial on Bayesian methods from the perspective of
neuroscientists (specifically compartmental neural modelers), focusing on
the problem of comparing two different compartmental neural models or model
classes.  We use Bayesian methods to estimate the relative probabilities of
the models given an agreed-upon data set.  We use two different methods to
estimate the likelihoods: one based on a simple sum-of-squared differences
in spike times (the Gaussian ISI model), and the other using a
variable-rate Poisson model.  We also illustrate the use of Bayesian
methods in the context of a realistic model of a layer 2 superficial
pyramidal cell from olfactory (piriform) cortex tuned on real neural data.
In the latter case, we use Bayesian methods to determine the optimal level
of noise added to the model so that the variability in the spike times in
the model is optimal given the data.  We also include a brief discussion of
the theoretical foundations of Bayesian inference.
