Ideas for scripts
=================

**********

Improvements in the `overlay.py` script.

I would like to be able to write:

  ---
  # title

  ```
  bla bla bla
  ```

  // OVERLAY
  // --> 1
  * comment 1
  // <-- 1
  // --> 2
  * comment 2
  // <-- 2
  // --> 3
  * comment 3
  // <-- 3
  // END OVERLAY   <-- not currently possible

What would even be more ambitious is to allow varying the code as well (e.g. by
highlighting different sections) but that quickly leads to diminishing returns.
