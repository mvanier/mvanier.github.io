.. _Software:

Installing the course software
==============================

In this course, we will be using the Haskell_ programming language.
Specifically, we will be using the GHC_ Haskell compiler.
We also assume a certain level of familiarity with a (Unix-like) terminal,
such as you would get in CS 1 or CS 4.

The easiest way to install GHC
is to use the `ghcup <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup>`_ installer.
See the `ghcup user guide <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/guide>`_
for instructions on how to use it.

``ghcup`` is a program intended to be run from a Unix-like terminal.
If your computer runs any flavor of Linux or MacOS,
you have direct access to such a terminal.
If your computer runs Windows,
you should install the `Windows Subsystem for Linux`_ (WSL).
Once this is done, you can run a Unix terminal on Windows
and install ``ghcup`` on that.

.. note::

   If you intend to use WSL, make sure you install the latest version!
   Early versions (|eg| version 1) do not work with GHC.
   In some cases, especially with older computers,
   installation will default to version 1,
   which will cause GHC installation to fail.
   In that case, contact the instuctor on Piazza.

   Also, once you have installed WSL, you can run it directly from the
   terminal embedded in `Visual Studio Code`_, which we recommend
   for Windows users.  Be sure not to select the Powershell terminal when
   starting a terminal; that isn't part of WSL.

After installing GHC, you want to make sure you are running the latest version,
which as of this writing is |ghcversion|.  To verify this, type:

.. code-block:: text

   $ ghc --version

You should see:

..
   We use "parsed-literal" here to allow substitutions.
   It's a nasty hack.

.. parsed-literal::

   The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version |ghcversion|

If you see a lower version number, you need to upgrade.  In a terminal, enter
these commands:

.. parsed-literal::

   $ ghcup install ghc |ghcversion|
   $ ghcup set ghc |ghcversion|

This should install the latest version.  Type

.. code-block:: text

   $ ghc --version

to verify that.  If that doesn't work, see a TA or the instructor.

You can also run

.. code-block:: text

   $ ghcup tui

to get a nice text user interface (TUI)
which allows you to interactively upgrade all GHC software
and tells you all the versions you've installed.
This will work on MacOS, Linux, and (maybe) on Windows with WSL.
It's not essential but it is pleasant to use.
