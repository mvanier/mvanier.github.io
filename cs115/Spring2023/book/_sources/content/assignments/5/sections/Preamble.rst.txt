Submitting your assignment
--------------------------

Write your code in a single text file called ``Lab5.hs``. These files
should be submitted to CodePost as ``Assignment 5``.


Writing and testing your code
-----------------------------

There is no code base for this assignment, so don't go looking for a
``lab5.zip`` file on Canvas |smile|.

There are no test scripts for this assignment. Some of the problems have
very specific answers, so you can easily test them interactively.
Others are written derivations, which don't lend themselves to tests.
