# CS 115:<br/>Functional Programming
## _Lecture 23_:<br/>Strictness

---
## Previously

* Monad transformers 

---
## Today

* We will look more deeply into laziness in Haskell 

* We will learn to control strictness
  using special functions, operators, and strictness annotations 

---
## Topics

* Why strictness matters (sometimes) 
* Thunks 
* Normal form (NF)
* Weak Head Normal Form (WHNF) 
* The `seq` function and the `$!` operator 
* Strictness annotations 
---
## Topics

* The `Control.DeepSeq` module<br/>(when all else fails)
  * The `NFData` type class and the `rnf` method 
  * The `deepseq` function and the `$!!` operator 

---
## Laziness: the good

* Haskell uses lazy evaluation 
* Lazy evaluation has some very nice properties!

---
## Laziness: the good

* Lazy evaluation can be more space-efficient:
  * Example: `map (2*) (filter (/= 0) lst)` 
    doesn't create intermediate list

---
## Laziness: the good

* Lazy evaluation can be more time-efficient:
  * Example: `smallest = head . sort` usually doesn't sort entire list

---
## Laziness: the good

* Lazy evaluation allows us to use infinite lists when appropriate
  * Haskell lists are called "streams" in most other languages 

---
## Laziness: the bad

* Lazy evaluation can cause problems!
* Seemingly simple expressions can cause "space leaks"
  which would not be there in strict languages
* Simple functional idioms from strict languages
  (Scheme, OCaml) may not translate to Haskell

---
## Laziness: the bad

* Classic example: factorials using tail-recursive accumulator:

<pre><code>factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer
factorial n = iter n 1
  where
    iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
    iter 0 r = r
    iter n r = iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

* Which arguments of `iter` are strict?

---
## Laziness: the bad

<pre><code>iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
iter 0 r = r
iter n r = iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

* Recall: a "strict" argument x is one in which <br/> `f $\bot$ = $\bot$`  
  * where $\bot$ is "bottom" (an infinite loop)

* Intuitively: a strict argument must be evaluated
  for the evaluation of the function as a whole to proceed

---
## Laziness: the bad

<pre><code>iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
iter <em>0</em> r = r
iter <em>n</em> r = iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

* Clearly, here `n` is a strict argument
  * We need to evaluate `n` in order to know which equation to use!

---
## Laziness: the bad

<pre><code>iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
iter <em>0</em> r = r
iter <em>n</em> r = iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

* Typically, strict arguments are found in `case` statements
  or in function definitions which desugar to `case` statements

* The `case` statement must evaluate the argument
  to decide which case to evaluate 

---
## Laziness: the bad

<pre><code>iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
iter 0 <em>r</em> = r
iter n <em>r</em> = iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

* Just as clearly, here `r` is _not_ a strict argument
* We can see this because `r` is identical
  on the left-hand side of both equations,
  which means that the choice of which equation to evaluate
  does not depend on `r`

---
## Laziness: the bad

* Sample evaluation:

<pre><code>iter 3 1
= iter (3 - 1) (3 * 1)
= iter 2 (3 * 1)
= iter (2 - 1) (2 * (3 * 1))
= iter 1 (2 * (3 * 1))
= iter (1 - 1)  (1 * (2 * (3 * 1)))
= iter 0 (1 * (2 * (3 * 1)))
</code></pre>

* Result: `1 * (2 * (3 * 1))`

---
## Laziness: the bad

* Similarly:

<pre><code>iter 8 1
</code></pre>

* Result:

<pre><code>1 * (2 * (3 * (4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * 1)))))))
</code></pre>

* Recall: Why write functions in tail-recursive form to begin with?
* Answer: to avoid unbounded use of stack space

---
## Laziness: the bad

* Similarly:

<pre><code>iter 8 1
</code></pre>

* Result:

<pre><code>1 * (2 * (3 * (4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * 1)))))))
</code></pre>

* This version of `iter` does not use unbounded *stack* space,
  but uses unbounded space for pending multiplications!

---
## Laziness: the bad

* Why doesn't Haskell evaluate the pending multiplications as it gets them?

* Answer: because nothing requires it to! (Laziness)

* The multiplications won't be forced
  until something needs a concrete value as the result of `iter`

---
## Laziness: the bad

* However, this means that we have a "space leak"
  which is not what we wanted!

* Is there a way to make Haskell behave strictly
  with respect to the `r` argument of `iter`?

---
## Laziness: the bad

* Is there a way to make Haskell behave strictly
  with respect to the `r` argument of `iter`?

* The answer is yes, and we will get to that shortly
* First, we need to talk about some theoretical terms:
  * thunk
  * normal form (NF)
  * weak head normal form (WHNF)

---
## Thunk

* A *thunk* is an unevaluated expression

* Unlike strict languages, Haskell doesn't evaluate function arguments
  unless they're needed

* Instead, it wraps them in a thunk, ready for evaluation if required

* If it gets evaluated, the thunk is replaced with the value of the thunk
  * This is a "hidden effect" of Haskell

---
## Normal Form

* An expression is in *normal form* (NF) if it is fully evaluated
  _i.e._ if it has been evaluated all the way to a Haskell value
  * This value cannot contain thunks, or it isn't in NF
  * An expression in NF cannot be evaluated further

* Strict languages always reduce function arguments to NF
  * so they don't need thunks!

---
## Weak Head Normal Form

* There exist intermediate points between "not evaluated at all" (thunk)
  and "completely evaluated" (normal form)
* In Haskell, one such point is called "weak head normal form" (WHNF)

---
## Weak Head Normal Form

* An expression in WHNF has been evaluated to either
  * the outermost data constructor
  * the outermost lambda abstraction
    * These are called the "head" of the expression
  * or a built-in function applied to too few arguments (like `(+) 2`)

---
## Weak Head Normal Form

* Examples:
  * `1 + 2` &nbsp; (not evaluated)
  * `"foo" ++ "bar"` &nbsp; (not evaluated)
  * `1 : 2 : 3 : []` &nbsp; (fully evaluated &nbsp; (NF))
  * `1 : 2 + 2 : 3 + 3 : []` &nbsp; (WHNF)
  * `1 + 1 : 2 + 2 : []` &nbsp; (still WHNF)

---
## Weak Head Normal Form

* Examples:
  * `(1 + 1, 2 + 2)` &nbsp; (still WHNF; tuple constructor)
  * `(\x -> x + x) 2` &nbsp; (not evaluated)
  * `\x -> 2 + 2` &nbsp; (WHNF)
  * `Just (2 + 2)` &nbsp; (WHNF)
* _N.B._ For scalars like integers,<br/>WHNF is the same as NF

---
## Head Normal Form

* There is also "head normal form" (HNF) but it is not relevant to Haskell

* For completeness, here it is:
  an expression is in HNF if it is in WHNF and,
  if it's a lambda abstraction,
  there is no reducible expression in the lambda body
* So &nbsp; `\x -> 2 + 2` &nbsp; is in WHNF but not HNF
* `\x -> 4` &nbsp; is in WHNF and HNF (and NF)
* Similarly, &nbsp; `\x -> (\y -> 2 * y) 2` &nbsp; is in WHNF but not HNF

---
## NF, HNF, WHNF

* If an expression is in NF, it is also in HNF and WHNF
* If an expression is in HNF, it is also in WHNF

---
## Why do we care?

* It is sometimes important to be able to control evaluation
  in ways that pure lazy evaluation won't give you
* There are ways to force evaluation to WHNF, or even to NF if desired

---
## The `seq` function

* The most fundamental way to force evaluation of an expression
  is the `seq` function
* It has this type:

<pre><code>seq :: a -&gt; b -&gt; b
</code></pre>

* `seq` takes two arguments
* It forces evaluation of the first one to WHNF, and returns the second

---
## The `seq` function

* One way to fix the accumulator example:

<pre><code>iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
iter 0 r = <em>seq</em> r r
iter n r = <em>seq</em> r $ iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

---
## The `seq` function

* We often write this using operator notation:

<pre><code>iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
iter 0 r = r <em>`seq`</em> r
iter n r = r <em>`seq`</em> iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

* _N.B._ `seq` is a primitive function
  * It can't be defined in Haskell

---
## The `$!` operator

* A very common scenario is &nbsp; ``x `seq` f x``
  to make the argument `x` strict when calling `f`.

* There is a shortcut for this: `f $! x`

* The `$!` operator has precedence 0, like the `$` operator
  * It's a "strict `$`"

---
## Strictness annotations

* Most of the time, we want to "strictify"
  one or more of the arguments to a function

* We could use `seq` or `$!`, but an easier way is to annotate the function
  argument with a _strictness annotation_

---
## Strictness annotations

* A strictness annotation is just a `!` before the function argument

* Strictness annotations are informally referred to as "bang patterns"
  * "bang" is slang for the `!` (exclamation mark)

---
## Strictness annotations

* Example:

<pre><code>iter :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
iter 0 <em>!</em>r = r
iter n <em>!</em>r = iter (n - 1) (n * r)
</code></pre>

* The strictness annotation ensures that the argument
  is reduced to WHNF before evaluating the right-hand side
* Since, for integers, WHNF is the same as NF,
  this function is strict in _both_ arguments (O(n) time, O(1) space usage)

---
## Strictness annotations

* Bang patterns can be put inside patterns:

<pre><code>f (<em>!</em>x, y) = [x, y]
</code></pre>

* Here, `x` will be evaluated to WHNF before computing the result

---
## Strictness annotations

* You can even do this:

<pre><code>f <em>!</em>(x, y) = [x, y]
</code></pre>

* but it will be no different from:

<pre><code>f (x, y) = [x, y]
</code></pre>

* (Why not?)
  * _Hint_: What is WHNF for a tuple?

---
## Constructors

* Data constructors, like functions, don't evaluate their arguments unless
  necessary

* This makes _e.g._ lists in Haskell into streams (lazy lists)

---
## Constructors

* There are advantages to this:
  * `[1..]` &nbsp; is an infinite list which we can still work with
  * `map (2 *) $ filter (/= 0) very_long_list` doesn't create large
    intermediate lists

* Sometimes, though, we may want a datatype whose arguments are strictly
  evaluated

---
## Constructors

* Example: Strict lists

<pre><code>data List a =
  Nil
| Cons <em>!</em>a (List a)
</code></pre>

* This is a list, each of whose elements is reduced to WHNF
* Note the strictness annotation `!` in the `Cons` constructor

---
## Constructors

* Another example: the complex number type (from the module `Data.Complex`):

<pre><code>data Complex a = <em>!</em>a :+ <em>!</em>a
</code></pre>

* Here, both the real and imaginary arguments have strictness annotations
  * meaning that both will be reduced to WHNF before making the `Complex`
  value

* Note that `Complex` is parameterized on a (presumably numeric) type

---
## Constructors

<pre><code>data Complex a = <em>!</em>a :+ <em>!</em>a
</code></pre>

* _N.B._ The `:+` is an _infix constructor_
  * these have to start with `:` and contain only symbolic characters

---
## `let`-bindings

* By default, `let` bindings are lazy
  * You are just saying that a name corresponds to an expression that may or
  may not be evaluated

* You can add strictness annotations to let bindings to force the expression
  to be evaluated to WHNF before it is bound to the name
* The syntax should be familiar by now:

<pre><code>let <em>!</em>x = ... in ...
</code></pre>

---
## Strict Haskell

* Sometimes, you want all function arguments and data constructor arguments
  to be evaluated to WHNF

* It's a pain to have to put strictness annotations on all functions and
  constructors!

* If you turn on the `Strict`
  language extension:<br/>`{-# LANGUAGE Strict #-}`<br/>
  then all function arguments and data constructor arguments in the module
  will act as if they have bang patterns (evaluate to WHNF)

* Don't use this unless there is a compelling reason to!

---
## Evaluating to normal form

* Sometimes, evaluating an expression to WHNF isn't enough
  * You may want to be certain that an expression is evaluated 
    all the way to NF
* Example: a list of integers in `ghci`:

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let lst = [1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, undefined]
</code></pre>

* Note that evaluating `undefined` gives an error:

<pre><code>ghci&gt; undefined
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
</code></pre>

* Let's play with this a bit

---
## Evaluating to normal form

* Evaluating `lst` to WHNF doesn't give rise to an error:

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let <em>!</em>lst = [1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, undefined]
</code></pre>

* We could also do it this way:

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let lst = [1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, undefined]
ghci&gt; let !lst' = lst
</code></pre>

* Still no error!  The list `lst` hasn't been evaluated to NF
* How can we force the evaluation of the entire list? 

---
## `Control.DeepSeq`

* First, we import the `Control.DeepSeq` module:

<pre><code>import Control.DeepSeq
</code></pre>

* This module defines the `NFData` type class,
  as well as functions and operators to help evaluate expressions to NF

---
## `Control.DeepSeq`

* The `NFData` type class defines the `rnf` (_reduce to normal form_) 
  method with this type signature:

<pre><code>rnf :: a -&gt; ()
</code></pre>

* `rnf` reduces a value of type `a` to normal form
* The default definition of `rnf` is:

<pre><code>rnf x = x `seq` ()
</code></pre>

---
## `NFData` and `rnf`

* We know that for some datatypes (_e.g._ `Int`), reducing to WHNF using
  `seq` is equivalent to reducing to NF
* What the `NFData` type class allows us to do is to define how to reduce
  _arbitrary_ types to NF
* For simple scalar types like `Int`, the default definition suffices 
* For something like `[Int]`, though, it doesn't
  * Lists can be reduced to WHNF without being reduced to NF

---
## `NFData` and `rnf`

* How could we define what `rnf` means for a list of values?
* Here is one way:
  * Require each element of the list to be an instance of `NFData`
  * Call `seq` on the list, reducing it to WHNF
  * Call `rnf` on the head of the list
  * Call `rnf` on the tail of the list
  * And we're done!

---
## `NFData` and `rnf`

* In fact, the definition of `rnf` for lists is as follows:

<pre><code>instance NFData a =&gt; NFData [a] where
  rnf [] = ()
  rnf (x:xs) = rnf x `seq` rnf xs
</code></pre>

* which is the same definition we came up with

---
## The `deepseq` function

* Normally, when we want to evaluate an expression to NF, we use the
  `deepseq` function from `Control.DeepSeq`
* It has this definition:

<pre><code>deepseq :: NFData a =&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; b
deepseq a b = rnf a `seq` b
</code></pre>

* In other words, `deepseq` is just like `seq` except that it evaluates all
  the way to normal form

---
## The `$!!` operator

* Similarly, there is an analog to the `$!` operator which evaluates its
  right-hand argument all the way to normal form before applying the function
  which is its left-hand argument
* This is the `$!!` operator, defined as:

<pre><code>($!!) :: (NFData a) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b
f $!! x = x `deepseq` f x
</code></pre>

---
## The `force` function

* There is also the `force` function, with this definition:

<pre><code>force :: (NFData a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
force x = x `deepseq` x
</code></pre>

* We can try it on our previous example:

<pre><code>ghci&gt; import Control.DeepSeq
ghci&gt; let lst = [1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, undefined]
ghci&gt; let lst' = force lst
</code></pre>

* Nothing happens!  Why?

---
## The `force` function

* The problem was that we didn't ask the second `let` to evaluate
   anything!
  * so the `force lst` is still wrapped in a thunk
  * _i.e._ `force` hasn't been forced!

* To fix this, we can try to use a strictness annotation
  to force the `force lst` thunk

* Let's try it again

---
## The `force` function

<pre><code>ghci&gt; import Control.DeepSeq
ghci&gt; let lst = [1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, undefined]
ghci&gt; let !lst' = force lst
</code></pre>

* Still doesn't work &#9785;

---
## The `force` function

<pre><code>ghci&gt; import Control.DeepSeq
ghci&gt; let lst = [1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, undefined]
ghci&gt; let lst' = force lst in head lst'
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
</code></pre>

* _This_ works, because:
  * `head lst'` forces evaluation of `lst'`,
  * which will then force evaluation of the entire list to NF via `force`,
  * and the `undefined` value at the end of the list
    caused an exception to be signalled

---
## The `force` function

* Without `force`, you get:

<pre><code>ghci&gt; import Control.DeepSeq
ghci&gt; let lst = [1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, undefined]
ghci&gt; let lst' = lst in head lst'
2
</code></pre>

* The `undefined` value never gets evaluated, as you'd expect

---
## Pitfalls with `deepseq`

* The biggest pitfall with `deepseq` and `$!!`
  is thinking that you actually need them!
* Programmers with experience with strict languages
  coming to Haskell often find that lazy evaluation makes them nervous
* There is a temptation to want to reduce everything to NF
  "just to be on the safe side"
* This is a _very bad idea_ in a lazy language like Haskell!

---
## Pitfalls with `deepseq`

* In fact, `deepseq` is very rarely needed
  * Almost always, `seq` and `$!` are sufficient
  * (If you need strictness at all!)
* And sometimes, laziness is _essential_
  to get a function working correctly and/or efficiently

---
## Pitfalls with `deepseq`

* We've seen that `rnf` can be quite a costly function
  * For lists, need to traverse the entire list,
    calling `rnf` on each element
* If we end up calling `rnf` on the same data structure repeatedly,
  we'll have to repeat that costly computation over and over
  * _Very_ wasteful!

---
## Pitfalls with `deepseq`

* There are tricks that can ensure
  that an `rnf` is only called once for a given argument,
  but they aren't part of the `Control.DeepSeq` module (yet)
  * Still part of "Haskell folklore"

* We don't recommend routine/casual use of `deepseq` and friends
  for normal Haskell programming

---
## When to use `deepseq`

* Often used as a way to debug a space leak that you suspect exists
  * Add `deepseq`, see if your space leak goes away

* The module `Control.Parallel.Strategies` contains a version of
  `deepseq` suitable for parallel evaluation
  * where you need fine-grained control over
    what gets evaluated when, and how much

---
## Conclusion

* Haskell is lazy by default
* This has benefits for modularity and sometimes efficiency
* On the other hand, sometimes the interplay between evaluated expressions 
  and unevaluated thunks can be very subtle
  * Worst case: you get space leaks!
* Sometimes we need or just want Haskell to be more strict
  than it is by default

---
## Conclusion

* We have several tools to help force evaluation of expressions to WHNF:
  * the `seq` function
  * the `$!` operator
  * strictness annotations on functions
  * strictness annotations on constructors
  * strictness annotations on `let`-bindings

---
## Conclusion

* When even this isn't enough,
  we can force evaluation all the way to NF
  using tools from the `Control.DeepSeq` module:
  * the `NFData` type class
  * the `deepseq` function
  * the `$!!` operator

* Have to use `deepseq` judiciously
  or it will actually make code _less_ efficient

---
## Wrapping up

* Thanks for taking the class!
* I hope you had fun, and learned something useful!
* I'd appreciate TQFR feedback (ideally constructive!)

---
## Further study

* I _strongly_ recommend reading the GHC user guide:
  * `https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide`

* Specific sections of interest:
  * `ghci` documentation
  * GHC optional language extensions<br/>(*tons* of them!)
  * GHC debugger

---
## Further study

* Mailing lists:
  * `Haskell-cafe`
  * `Haskell-beginners`

* Haskell Reddit site is full of useful information
  * blog posts
  * discussion of research papers
  * announcements of new libraries/programs

* Haskell IRC channel is great for real-time help
* Most importantly: write code, and have fun!
