Introduction
============

Welcome to CS 128!
------------------

This book serves as the official course notes, so that lectures are less of a
brain dump of details and more an opportunity to interactively go through
course topics, answer questions, and get you thinking about the material.
In addition, we will be posting most of the course-related content in these
pages, including:

* the course :doc:`syllabus <admin/Syllabus>`
  (which you should read as soon as possible!)
* administrative details
* instructions on how to set up your computer with the course software
* assignments

and anything else we consider useful.  Your feedback on these notes will be
very helpful to us in improving them, so please let us know if anything is hard
to understand or if something that should be here isn't.

Course-related material we won't post here includes:

* lecture slides
* code supplied to students for assignments
* some administrative information |eg| contact information

These will be posted on the course Canvas page in the Modules section.
