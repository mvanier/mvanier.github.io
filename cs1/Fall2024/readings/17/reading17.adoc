= CS 1 Reading 17: Computer graphics and `tkinter`, part 2

== Overview

In this reading we continue our discussion of computer graphics using
`tkinter`.

== Topics

* More on event handling (callbacks)

* Graphical object "handles" in `tkinter`

* Global variables

== More on event handling

=== Fixing the `q` callback function

In the last reading, we ended up with the following code:

[source, python]
----
from tkinter import *

root = Tk()
root.geometry('800x600')
c = Canvas(root, width=800, height=600)
c.pack()
a = c.create_rectangle(0, 0, 50, 50, fill='red', outline='red')
# Bind the event "type the q key" to the `quit` function:
root.bind('<q>', quit)
root.mainloop()
----

The idea here was to have a graphical program that we could quit
by typing the `q` key.
All the program does is put up a red square on a `tkinter` canvas.
We use the `root.bind` method to bind an _event_ (typing the `q` key)
to an _action_ (executing the built-in `quit` function).
We saw that using the `quit` function as an argument to the method was unusual
because `quit` is a function.
We have to leave off the parentheses from the `quit` function we pass to
`root.bind` or else it will get executed (and thus the program will exit)
when the `root.bind` method is called,
which is obviously not what we want.
We don't want the program to exit when we _bind_ the `quit` function
to the `q` key,
we want the `quit` function to be _stored_ so that it can be called later when
the `q` key is typed.
When you leave off the parentheses,
then `quit` is just a function object and is not called.

In the last reading,
we saw that when the `quit` function is finally called,
it will print out some useless stuff to the terminal before the program exits.
The reason is does this is that the `quit` function prints out its argument
unless the argument is an integer.
But in `tkinter`, every callback function receives exactly one argument,
which is the event that triggered it.
Since events in `tkinter` are not integers,
the `quit` function will convert its event argument to a string
and print it to the terminal, which we don't want.
What we need is a callback function that we can use with the `q` key
that won't print anything when the event occurs.
The easiest way to achieve this is to write a simple wrapper function
around the `quit` function that simply ignores the event argument.

The resulting code looks like this:

[source, python]
----
from tkinter import *

def exit_python(event):
    """Exit python when the event 'event' occurs."""
    quit()  # no arguments to quit

root = Tk()
root.geometry('800x600')
c = Canvas(root, width=800, height=600)
c.pack()
a = c.create_rectangle(0, 0, 50, 50, fill='red', outline='red')
root.bind('<q>', exit_python)
root.mainloop()
----

All we've done here is to replace the `quit` function
in the call to `root.bind`
with the `exit_python` callback function.
The only interesting thing about the `exit_python` callback function
is that it ignores its event argument
and calls the `quit` function without any arguments.
As a result, when the program is running and we type the `q` key,
the program exits without typing anything to the terminal.
Woo hoo! {smiley}

=== Variations on binding

It's easy to create variations on this program.
All we have to do is change the event that causes the program to exit.
For instance, by replacing the line:

----
root.bind('<q>', exit_python)
----

with:

----
root.bind('<Key>', exit_python)
----

then the program will quit when _any_ key on the keyboard is typed, not just
the `q` key.

If we change it again to:

----
root.bind('<Button-1>', exit_python)
----

then the program will exit when the left mouse button is clicked.
(The left mouse button is referred to as `'<Buttonâ€“1>'` in `tkinter`.)

So far, we've been binding our event handlers to the root window object
(`root`) only.
But the root window object is not the only object that can handle events.
The canvas object is also capable of handling events.
What happens if we try to bind the `exit_python` event handler
to the canvas object?
Let's change the `bind` line to this:

----
c.bind('<q>', exit_python)   # `c` is the Canvas object
----

Now, when we run the program and type the `q` key, nothing happens!
On the other hand, if we change the bind line to this:

----
c.bind('<Button-1>', exit_python)
----

then clicking the left mouse button _does_ quit the program.
What's going on?

Although the canvas object _can_ handle events,
tt can only handle certain kinds of events.
In particular, it can't handle key press events.
When you think about it, this makes perfect sense --
there's no particular reason why you should expect a canvas
to be able to handle key press events,
because a canvas is not normally used for text entry.
However, it's pretty clear that a canvas _will_ have to be able to handle
mouse button click events,
since canvas objects are often used to write {eg} drawing programs.

When a graphical object receives an event it doesn't know how to handle,
it passes the event to its parent.
So even though the canvas object will see key press events
before the root window does,
it won't be able to handle it.
So it will pass it immediately to its parent, the root window object.
If the root window object has a binding to that event,
it will call the callback function bound to that event.
If not, nothing will happen (the event will be ignored).

On the other hand, if the canvas receives an event it _can_ handle,
it will look up the event to see if it's bound to an event handler.
If it is, then it will execute the event handler.
Since the canvas can handle mouse button click events,
the last example works.

== Other callback functions

Now we're going to work through some more graphics programs.
Each will have the same overall structure,
but the details will be different.
There will be different callback functions,
and different drawing functions to support them.

=== Program 1: print mouse cursor location

This program will

* quit when `q` is pressed

* print out the (x, y) coordinates of the mouse cursor
(relative to the canvas window) when the left mouse button is clicked

[source, python]
----
from tkinter import *

def exit_python(event):
    """Exit Python."""
    quit()

def button_handler(event):
    """Handle left mouse button click events."""
    print('x = {}, y = {}'.format(event.x, event.y))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry('800x600')
    canvas = Canvas(root, width=800, height=600)
    canvas.pack()

    root.bind('<q>', exit_python)
    canvas.bind('<Button-1>', button_handler)

    root.mainloop()
----

From this we see that typing the `q` key exits Python as usual,
and clicking the left mouse button calls the callback function
`button_handler`,
passing it an `event` object which contains all the information
about that mouse click.

The `button_handler` function is new.
It takes an `event` argument as usual, but this time
the event is a mouse button click.
This event has two _attributes_ associated with it,
`event.x` and `event.y`.
These represent the (relative) X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor
at the moment the mouse button was clicked.

.Event attributes and the dot syntax
****

Python refers to the contents of an object as its _attributes_.
It uses the familiar dot syntax to access them and to change them.
In the case of the event, `x` and `y` are two attributes,
so to access them we write `event.x` and `event.y`.
If we wanted to change them, we would write {eg} `event.x = 10`.

So far, we've used the dot syntax mostly for calling methods on objects, and
also for calling functions defined in a module.
But the dot syntax is more general than this.
What it really does is fetch
(or change, if it's used on the left of an `=` sign)
an attribute of an object.
If that attribute happens to be a function or a method,
and there is an argument list after the function or method,
it calls the function/method.
But many useful attributes are non-function data.
For instance, the `x` and `y` attributes of an event
are integers representing pixel coordinates.

Some authors refer to these kinds of attributes
(non-function attributes or data attributes)
as _fields_ of an object,
and sometimes we'll use that terminology too.

****

=== Program 2: draw random squares

Now that we can capture the X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor,
there are lots of things that we can do with this information.
This leads us to our next program.
In this program, clicking on the mouse will draw a square
centered at the (x, y) coordinate where the mouse cursor is.
This square will have a random color and a random size
(within a specified range).
We only need to make a couple of changes to the previous program.

[source, python]
----
from tkinter import *
import random

def draw_random_square(canvas, x, y, min_size, max_size):
    # Code omitted (assignment problem).

def exit_python(event):
    """Exit Python."""
    quit()

def button_handler(event):
    """Handle left mouse button click events."""
    draw_random_square(canvas, event.x, event.y, 50, 150)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry('800x600')
    canvas = Canvas(root, width=800, height=600)
    canvas.pack()

    # Bind events to handlers.
    root.bind('<q>', exit_python)
    canvas.bind('<Button-1>', button_handler)

    # Start it up.
    root.mainloop()
----

The only thing new here is that instead of printing out the X and Y coordinates
when the mouse is clicked, the `draw_random_square` function is called instead.

[NOTE]
====

We are omitting the code for that function because you have to write it
yourself for one of the assignments.

====

The `draw_random_square` function takes as its arguments:

* the canvas object
* the X and Y coordinates where the mouse cursor was when the mouse button was
  clicked
* the minimum and maximum allowed sizes of the square, in pixel coordinates

It draws a square on the canvas with a random color and a random size
(within the specified bounds)
centered on the given X and Y coordinates.
It doesn't return anything (at least, not in this version of the program).

We consider the "size" of a square to be the length
of one of the sides of the square in pixels.
So we will be drawing squares whose sizes are randomly set to a number
between `min_size` and `max_size` pixels long.

.Color representation
****

The way that colors are represented on most computer monitors is with separate
values for the red, green, and blue components of the color (so called "RGB"
colors).  Typically, 8 bits are assigned to each color, so each color can have
a value going from 0 (which means the color is absent) to 255 (`2**8 - 1` or
`0b11111111` in binary).  To represent a color in `tkinter`, you just have to
have a 6-digit hexadecimal number with a leading `\#` character.  Such a color
uses 2 hexadecimal digits for each color. Recall that a hexadecimal digit
represents 4 bits, so two can represent 8 bits.  Generating random hexadecimal
digits is not hard, and collecting 6 of them and putting a `#` character before
them gives you a string which represents a random color as far as `tkinter` is
concerned.

Some examples:

* white is `#ffffff`
* black is `#000000`
* red is `#ff0000`
* green is `#00ff00`
* blue is `#0000ff`
* yellow is `#ffff00`  (red + green)

Of course, if you replace `ff` by something else, you get less of that color.

****

In addition to this, we had to change the `button_handler` callback function
so that it calls `draw_random_square`:

[source, python]
----
def button_handler(event):
    """Handle left mouse button click events."""
    draw_random_square(canvas, event.x, event.y, 50, 150)
----

`draw_random_square` is called with the (global) `canvas` object,
the `x` and `y` attributes of the `event`,
and the bounds of the size of the square (50 and 150).
When this program is run, clicking on the left mouse button
will draw squares of random size and color,
centered on where the mouse cursor was when the left mouse button was clicked.

== Global variables

We just mentioned that the `canvas` object is a global object.  Let's look into
that a bit more.

Anything defined at the "top level" of a program ({ie} not inside a function or
a class) is a _global variable_.  This applies even to the last part of the
program:

[source, python]
----
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry('800x600')
    canvas = Canvas(root, width=800, height=600)
    canvas.pack()

    # Bind events to handlers.
    root.bind('<q>', exit_python)
    canvas.bind('<Button-1>', button_handler)

    # Start it up.
    root.mainloop()
----

Since this `if` statement isn't inside a function or a class footnote:[We'll
learn about classes in the next reading.] then any variables defined inside it
are global variables.  Here, there are two of them: `root` and `canvas`.

A global variable can be used anywhere in the entire program, inside any
function or outside a function.  When we say "used" we mean that the value of a
global variable can be accessed anywhere.  However, it's not possible to
_change_ the value of a global variable everywhere unless you use a special
command, which we'll get to shortly.

[NOTE]
It might strike you as odd that the definition of the `button_handler` function
uses the `canvas` variable before that variable has even been defined.
This looks like it should be an error, but it isn't.
The reason is that Python doesn't actually execute any of the `button_handler`
code while it is being defined; it just saves it for later.
What's important is that the `button_handler` function isn't _called_
until `canvas` is defined,
and the way that we have set things up, it won't be.

In general, you should *avoid using global variables*.
Global variables cause problems because they can be changed
inside any function,
and if a global variable gets the wrong value,
it can be hard to find out where that wrong value came from.
So global variables make debugging harder.
In contrast, local variables can only be changed
inside the function in which they were defined,
so if a local variable has the wrong value,
you usually don't have to look at much code to figure out why.

Having said all of this, why are we using a global variable here?
Why can't we just pass `canvas` as an extra argument to the
`button_handler` callback function?
The reason is that `tkinter` callback functions are only allowed
to have a _single_ argument: the event that triggers them.
When the event occurs, the callback will be called
with that event as the only argument.
So there is no easy way to supply the extra argument.
Instead, since the `canvas` object is already a global variable,
we just use it directly.

In general, if we need any data in a callback function other than the event,
we have to access it as a global variable
(at least, given what we know now).

[NOTE]
====

There is a "nice" solution to this problem which does not require global
variables.
It will involve Python _classes_ (user defined object types).
Classes are one of the central concepts in object-oriented programming,
and we will learn about them starting with the next reading.
For now, we'll stick to using global variables (and hold our noses).

There is _another_ nice solution to this problem
which does not require global variables _or_ classes,
and it is even simpler than classes!
It involves creating an _anonymous function_
(called a "lambda expression" in Python).
We will discuss this later in the course.
It's a classic example of _functional programming_,
which is covered in much more detail in CS 4 and CS 115.
It's important to understand that the same problem
can often be solved in different ways using either
object-oriented programming or functional programming.
Python gives you a lot of flexibility to choose the way you prefer.

====

== Graphical object "handles" in `tkinter`

So far we've seen how to create graphical objects

* directly as part of the program
* through user interaction with callback functions

However, once we've created an object, we haven't done anything with it.
It would be useful to be able to manipulate an object after it's created:
to move it, change it in some way, delete it, {etc}

`tkinter` has had this ability all along -- we just haven't been using it!
`tkinter` canvas commands to create graphical objects all return a value.
This value is called a _handle_ to the graphical object.
The handle is not the graphical object itself!
In `tkinter`, handles are just integers starting from `1` which indicate
the order in which graphical objects on a canvas were created.
So the handle `1` means
"the first graphical object to be created on this canvas",
the handle `7` means
"the seventh graphical object to be created on this canvas",
{etc}
You can use handles as a way to identify specific graphical objects
on a canvas, and that's exactly what `tkinter` does.

[NOTE]
Don't confuse _event handlers_
(functions which are called when certain events happen)
with canvas graphical object _handles_.
There is no relationship whatsoever between the two concepts;
they just both happen to use the word "handle".

Canvas objects don't let you _directly_ manipulate the objects they contain;
you have to do it indirectly by calling `tkinter` functions and methods
that require handles as arguments.
In other words, graphical objects on canvasses
(like rectangles, ovals, lines, {etc})
are not exposed as Python objects.
footnote:[This is kind of ugly, but we will do something about it soon.]

=== Example: deleting graphical objects from a canvas

Our programs have created a bunch of graphical objects (squares) on a canvas.
After a while, a canvas can get very cluttered.
We might want to delete some or all of the existing squares.
We can do this easily using handles!

We will extend our program so that pressing the `c` key
(`c` for "clear") will remove all the squares from the canvas.

Above we mentioned this function:

----
def draw_random_square(canvas, x, y, min_size, max_size):
    # ... code omitted ...
----

Somewhere in this function there would need to be a call to

----
    canvas.create_rectangle(...)
----

Whatever this method returns is ignored,
and `draw_random_square` doesn't return anything.
We will change this line to:

----
    square = canvas.create_rectangle(...)
----

And we will make `draw_random_square` return this value
(a handle, which is just a Python `int`).
Properties of the square (its position, color {etc}) are stored inside
the canvas object.

OK, so `draw_random_square` returns a handle to a square on a particular
canvas.
We want to store this handle so we can delete the square later on.
We will create a (global) list of square handles
and add every new square handle to the list.

At the end of the program, we add one line:

[source, highlight=6]
----
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry('800x600')
    canvas = Canvas(root, width=800, height=600)
    canvas.pack()
    squares = []   # new
    # rest of code as before
----

Now we can store all handles to squares in the (global) list called `squares`.

We will also modify the `button_handler` callback function:

[source, python]
----
def button_handler(event):
    """Handle left mouse button click events."""
    square = draw_random_square(canvas, event.x, event.y, 50, 150)
    squares.append(square)
----

All newly-created handles to squares get appended to the global `squares` list.

Next, we change the callback function for key presses:

[source, python]
----
def key_handler(event):
    """Handle key press events."""
    key = event.keysym
    if key == 'q':
        quit()
    elif key == 'c':
        for square in squares:
            canvas.delete(square)

# Later in the code:
root.bind('<Key>', key_handler)
----

The `key_handler` callback function will handle all key press events,
although we are only interested in the `q` (for quit) 
and `c` (for clear) keys.

This function shows another event attribute that is found on key press events:
`event.keysym`.  
This is just the character on the key that was pressed:
`'q'` for the `q` key, `'c'` for the `c` key, {etc}
The `q` key quits Python as before.
The `c` key deletes all the squares from the canvas
using the `canvas.delete` method.
This method takes a single argument, 
which is the handle of the graphical object to delete.

[NOTE]
====

As you can see, different events have different attributes.
Key press events will have a `keysym` attribute
but they won't have `x` and `y` attributes,
because this doesn't mean anything when a key is pressed.
Button click events will have `x` and `y` attributes,
but they won't have a `keysym` attribute,
because that has no meaning in the context of mouse button clicks.

====

The entire program (without the part that's in the assignment) looks like this:

[source, python]
----
from tkinter import *
import random

def draw_random_square(canvas, x, y, min_size, max_size):
    # ... code omitted ...

def button_handler(event):
    """Handle left mouse button click events."""
    square = draw_random_square(canvas, event.x, event.y, 50, 150)
    squares.append(square)

def key_handler(event):
    """Handle key press events."""
    key = event.keysym
    if key == 'q':
        quit()
    elif key == 'c':
        # Clear all squares from the canvas.
        for square in squares:
            canvas.delete(square)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry('800x600')
    canvas = Canvas(root, width=800, height=600)
    canvas.pack()

    squares = []

    root.bind('<Key>', key_handler)
    canvas.bind('<Button-1>', button_handler)

    root.mainloop()
----

If we ran this program (after completing `draw_random_square`, of course)
we would find that pressing the `c` key
would indeed remove all the squares from the canvas.

=== Globals again

There's one problem with this approach:
the squares in the `squares` list were deleted
using the `canvas.delete` method.
But the `squares` list itself wasn't emptied out.
This means that we are storing handles to squares that no longer exist,
which is unnecessary and might cause problems later.
Let's try to fix that now.

[source, python, linenums, highlight=10]
----
def key_handler(event):
    """Handle key press events."""
    key = event.keysym
    if key == 'q':
        quit()
    elif key == 'c':
        # Clear all squares from the canvas.
        for square in squares:
            canvas.delete(square)
        squares = []
----

Here, in line 10, we're trying to change the global variables `squares`
by assigning the empty list to it.
Only one problem: it won't work!

Python has no way of knowing that `squares` on line 10 
is supposed to represent a global variable.
It could just as well be a local variable that we decided to create 
at that point in the function.
When in doubt, Python assumes that a variable is a local variable,
not a global variable.

How do we tell it that `squares` is supposed to be a global variable,
not a local variable?
Simple: we _declare_ that it's a global variable with a `global` declaration:

[source, python, linenums, highlight=3]
----
def key_handler(event):
    """Handle key press events."""
    global squares
    key = event.keysym
    if key == 'q':
        quit()
    elif key == 'c':
        # Clear all squares from the canvas.
        for square in squares:
            canvas.delete(square)
        squares = []
----

The `global` declaration in line 3 tells Python that `squares`
refers only to a _global_ variable
inside the `key_handler` function.
Now, the global `squares` list will be cleared 
every time the `c` key is pressed.

[NOTE]
====

Without the `global` declaration, 
a Python program can have the same name bound 
to both a local and a global variable.
When this happens, the local variable takes precedence 
(it "shadows" the global variable).
Try hard to avoid this situation even if the code works,
since it's very confusing to anyone reading your code!

====

Some rules of thumb for global variables:

* If you want to _access_ a global variable inside a function,
  and there is no local variable with the same name,
  just access it as usual.

* If you want to _modify_ a global variable inside a function,
you have to declare it as global using the `global` declaration.

It's a pain to remember to do this,
so avoid using global variables if possible.
Classes (next reading) are a better alternative.
