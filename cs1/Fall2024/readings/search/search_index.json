We hope you have a lot of fun and learn a lot in the process.</p> <p>This is the first \"reading\" of the course. The idea behind readings is to serve as the official course notes, so that lectures are less of a brain dump of details and more an opportunity to interactively go through code examples, answer questions, and get you thinking about the programming process. We will try to post the reading(s) corresponding to a lecture at least a day before the lecture. You should ideally have read it (them) before coming to lecture, so you can use class time to ask questions about the material and refine your understanding. We will use the questions you ask in the lecture to improve the readings.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The readings will roughly correspond to the lecture topics, but it's not an exact equivalence; some topics may be covered more deeply in the readings than in lectures or vice-versa.</p>"},{"location":"1/reading1/#topics","title":"Topics","text":"<p>This reading is a general introduction to programming and Python, followed by a short crash course on the most basic aspects of Python, which will be continued in the next reading.</p>"},{"location":"1/reading1/#your-programming-background","title":"Your programming background","text":"<p>We are very well aware that students in CS 1 come from a very wide variety of backgrounds in terms of knowledge of computer programming. Some of you have never programmed a computer before. That's fine; you're in the right place! Others have done some or perhaps even extensive programming. We will try to make these notes accessible to everyone, and if there is a topic that you are very familiar with, we encourage you to skim (but not to skip) the notes on that topic.</p>"},{"location":"1/reading1/#programming-as-a-thought-process","title":"Programming as a thought process","text":"<p>[This section is for new programmers; experienced programmers can skip to the next section.]</p> <p>The hardest subjects to learn are usually those that force you to think in a different way than you're used to. For instance, when you learn algebra, you have to generalize the arithmetic you've learned (\"ten apples times three equals thirty apples\") to allow for unknown quantities (variables) (\"<code>x</code> apples times <code>y</code> equals <code>xy</code> apples\"). That's a mental leap. When you learn calculus you have to generalize what you know about functions to allow for operations like derivatives that take functions as arguments. And when you learn programming for the first time, you have to learn to \"think like a machine\". This is what we mean when we speak of programming as a thought process. \"Thinking like a machine\" means understanding enough about how the computer works to be able to predict what the result of executing your code is going to be.</p> <p>Thinking like a machine isn't necessarily hard, but it is different. The machine (the computer) works by iron-clad rules of logic, doing many very simple operations at blinding speed. We write programs to tell computers what to do, and the computer will do exactly what we tell it to, no more and no less, whether it makes sense or not. There is no room for error; if you get a single character wrong in your program, it will either do the wrong thing or not run at all. The computer doesn't know or care what you \"meant\" it to do, only what you specifically asked it to do. It is completely literal and completely unforgiving. You should expect to spend a lot of time fixing mistakes in your programs (which are called \"bugs\") to finally get it to do the right thing.</p>  The first bug ever found (1947): a moth trapped in the Mark II computer in Harvard University.  <p>Fortunately, the computer has a number of safeguards which prevent you from doing anything really horrible (so running a program is unlikely to physically destroy the computer itself, for instance); usually, if you make a mistake, it will just complain that something went wrong and halt, or else it'll just not do what you wanted it to.</p> <p>Learning to understand the very logical, very exact, very literal and incredibly picky way a computer works is going to take time. We're not going to lie to you: programming can be incredibly frustrating. But once you finally get it to do what you want, it's incredibly satisfying, and with experience, the less frustrating it gets and the more satisfying it is. (But the frustration never goes away entirely!) We will be trying to help you learn to \"think like a machine\" all through this course. Often, we will not give you the whole story about what is happening when we first introduce a topic, because to do that would take too long and be tedious. But as we visit and revisit topics, we will fill in more and more of the gaps so that eventually you'll have a very good idea of what happens when your programs execute. (To get a really deep understanding of all this, though, you'll have to take more courses than just CS 1!) Don't worry; it's going to be fun!</p>"},{"location":"1/reading1/#program-design-as-a-thought-process","title":"Program design as a thought process","text":"<p>[This section is for beginning and experienced programmers alike.]</p> <p>Even after you internalize the first thought process (thinking like a machine) you have to learn another thought process: how to design programs. You will have to write many functions and programs in this course. You'll be given a pretty precise description of what the function or program is supposed to do, and then you will have to write the code to do it. This is a creative act! There is always going to be more than one way to solve all but the simplest problems, and there is never going to be an objectively \"perfect\" answer. But for many programmers, even ones who understand the workings of a programming language quite well, it can be challenging to put together the elements of the programming language in the right way to solve a problem. We call this activity program design. As a creative act, we can't give exact rules on how to do it, but we can give guidelines, rules of thumb, and general wisdom we've accumulated over our years of programming. Knowing these guidelines and rules of thumb should help you when you have to write a function (or class, or module) but don't know where to start.</p> <p>The details of the programming languages we'll be teaching you (first Python, and then Java) will be in these readings. The thought process behind program design will mainly be covered in lectures, often by simply showing you a problem and walking through the steps needed to solve it. That way, you'll see how experienced programmers think about a problem, and you can apply what you learn to your own programs.</p>"},{"location":"1/reading1/#programming-jargon","title":"Programming jargon","text":"<p>Another challenge for beginning programmers is that programming uses a lot of common words with very specific meanings that aren't the usual meanings. Words like list, dictionary, string, file, function, interpreter and so on mean very different things when used in a programming context than they would mean in everyday conversation. We will try hard to be incredibly clear on what a particular programming term means, especially if that meaning is different from the common meaning. If you find a term we are using confusing, let us know so we can improve these readings!</p>"},{"location":"1/reading1/#the-choice-of-programming-languages","title":"The choice of programming language(s)","text":"<p>We will be using two programming languages in this course: Python and Java. We will use Python for about the first two-thirds of the course, and then switch to Java for the remainder of the course.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Java is the only language used in CS 2, so it's important that you learn it before taking that course. Java is also well worth knowing in its own right.</p> <p>Python is an excellent first programming language. It's very useful for teaching the basic concepts of programming, and it's also an incredibly useful real-world language. Perhaps most relevant to you, Python has in recent years emerged as one of the most important programming languages in science and data analysis, as well as one of the most-used languages in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Python is easy to learn, incredibly versatile, very readable, and very consistent. You may know some (or a lot!) of Python already, but even in that case we're pretty sure we're going to be teaching you some new things about it.</p> <p></p> <p>We love Python both as a teaching language and as a language we use ourselves, but don't kid yourself: it's not the only good or useful programming language. As we mentioned, near the end of this course (and in CS 2) you will learn Java. if you take CS 3 and/or CS 11, you will learn C, and if you take CS 4 you will learn OCaml. Serious programmers need to know more than one language, so think of this as the start of your programming journey. Programming is a lot of fun, and we hope to show you why we love it so much and why it's so exciting to learn computer science.</p>"},{"location":"1/reading1/#a-brief-history-of-python","title":"A brief history of Python","text":"<p>Computer languages have weird names. Some, like <code>C</code>, are completely arbitrary and meaningless.<sup>1</sup> Others, like <code>Java</code> or <code>Ruby</code>, are named after something (coffee and the gem stone, respectively). <code>Python</code> is named after the British comedy group Monty Python's Flying Circus. It was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer who wanted a language that was easier to use than C for everyday tasks. Guido was also a fan of the comedy group, so he named his language after them as an homage.</p> <p>Python has been under continual development ever since it was created, and the latest version of Python available as of this writing is Python 3.12.4. Python is now one of the most popular programming languages in use today.</p> <p>The Python home page is at https://www.python.org.

You simply won't be able to run them yourselves yet.</p> <p>However, we strongly recommend that you do get Python set up as soon as possible and follow along with the readings by typing in the examples and playing around with them; you'll learn a lot more that way and it'll be more fun too.</p> <p>Here is a snippet of Python code:</p> <pre><code>print('Hello, world!')\n</code></pre> <p>Believe it or not, this is a complete Python program! When run from a terminal window, it will print the words <code>Hello, world!</code> to the terminal.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Terminals</p> <p>A terminal (more jargon!) is a program which allows you to directly type commands to your computer and receive textual output back from the computer. Some of you may never have used a terminal, because non-programmers typically have little use for one. Programmers use them all the time, and some of us spend most of our time on the computer working inside a terminal. Terminal programs include Terminal.app and Iterm.app (MacOS), Windows Terminal (Windows), and many different programs for Linux. You can run Python programs directly from a terminal, and we'll show you lots of examples of this.</p> <p>We will get into the details of Python below, but just so you aren't confused: the words <code>'Hello, world!'</code> in single quotes are a Python string (which is the way textual data is represented inside Python). The word <code>print</code> stands for a built-in Python function which takes a single argument (in this case the string <code>'Hello, world!'</code>) and prints it out to the terminal.<sup>4</sup> We'll talk more about functions in the next reading, and we'll cover strings in detail after that.</p> <p>The colors in the Python code snippet have nothing to do with the Python language; they are what is called \"syntax coloring\". Its purpose is just to make the code a bit more readable by highlighting different parts of the code in different ways.

Python source code files are plain text files with a specific suffix, which is <code>.py</code>. Usually, the name of a source code file is in all lowercase letters; for instance, you might have one called <code>lab1.py</code> or <code>sudoku.py</code>.</p> <p>Let's say we've written a file of Python code called <code>hello.py</code> which contains the following code:</p> <pre><code>print('Hello, world!')\n</code></pre> <p>We can run this file by typing the following command at a terminal command line:</p> <pre><code>$ python hello.py\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>$</code> is called a prompt; you don't type it.</p> <p>Prompts</p> <p>Your prompt may look different from this. It doesn't matter. The purpose of the prompt is to highlight where on the terminal the commands you type are going to be displayed.</p> <p>Inside a terminal there is a program called a shell which is running. The shell is the program which interprets commands like this. (Most people think of the terminal and the shell as one combined entity, but they are actually separate; a shell runs inside of a terminal.)</p> <p>The shell prompt (the <code>$</code> above) is printed automatically when the shell is waiting for more input.

If it's running Windows, you can get to a terminal prompt like this by installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux, but don't worry about this now; there are other ways to run Python programs.
