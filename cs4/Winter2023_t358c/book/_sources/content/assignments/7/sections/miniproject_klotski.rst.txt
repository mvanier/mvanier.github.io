Miniproject: The "Klotski" sliding-block puzzle game
====================================================

Game description
----------------

The puzzle game `Klotski <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski>`__
is an example of a "sliding block puzzle game",
whereby the pieces (blocks) can slide around on the game board,
and the goal is to reach a desired configuration.
There are a number of these games ("Rush Hour" is another well-known one).
Klotski is both extremely simple (in terms of the rules) and extremely
difficult to solve for many possible puzzles.

The Wikipedia page for Klotski is
`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski>`__.

Here are the rules of the game. The game is played on a 5x4 grid (5
rows, 4 columns) which we’ll call the "board". The pieces are either 1x1
blocks, 1x2 horizontal blocks (1 row by 2 columns), 2x1 vertical blocks
(2 rows by 1 column), or 2x2 blocks (2 rows by 2 columns). There is
always exactly one 2x2 block on the board, but there can be any number
(including zero) of the other kinds of blocks, except that blocks can’t
overlap each other and there is only enough space for so many blocks.
The game starts with a number of pieces already placed on the board,
including the special 2x2 block. Once this has been done, you play the
game by moving one piece per move. Pieces can be moved in either the
horizontal or vertical direction, but they can’t rotate. You can move a
piece any number of spaces, as long as (a) you don’t move any part of
the piece off the board, and (b) no part of the piece goes over another
piece or lands on another piece. The goal of the game is to move the 2x2
piece to the two bottom rows and the two middle columns. Conceptually,
this puts the piece next to an "exit door" right below the middle two
columns, so the piece can "escape". The objective of the game is to get
the 2x2 piece to the target location in the fewest number of moves. And
that is it for rules.

To illustrate these rules in action, see the example game in the next
section.

The name "Klotski" comes from the Polish word "klocki", which means
"wooden blocks". The original Klotski puzzles were physical puzzles made
from sliding wooden blocks. The game may have actually originated in
America; versions of it were known to exist in 1909.


Example game
------------

Here is an example of what a complete game will look like when you
compile the code in the file ``interact.ml`` (assuming that all your own
code in ``klotski.ml`` works properly) by typing ``make interact`` at
the command prompt (or just ``make``). You run the game by typing this
at the terminal prompt:

.. code-block:: text

   $ ./klotski_interact 0

This will use board number 0 (from ``boards.ml``) as the starting
configuration. Board numbers can range from 0 to 7, with higher numbers
requiring many more moves to solve.

Here is a transcript of an interactive game in its entirety with this
input board. Pieces are displayed using letters, with the different
locations of a piece represented by the same letter on adjacent
locations.  Empty squares are represented by a period (``.``).
The goal is to get the 2x2 piece (represented on this
particular board by the character ``'f'``) to the bottom two rows and
the middle two columns as described above.

User input comes after the prompt ``"Enter move: "``. User input
consists of a string of three characters, which are: (1) the name
(label) of the piece to be moved (for instance, piece ``c``), which
direction to move it (``u`` for up, ``d`` for down, ``l`` for left, or
``r`` for right) and how far to move it (for instance, ``1`` or ``2``).
The distance must be a positive integer no larger than ``4`` (otherwise,
the piece would end up off the board). You are not allowed to make a
move which moves any component of a piece off the board or on top of or
through another piece.

.. code-block:: text

   $ ./klotski_interact 0

   aabb
   .cc.
   ddee
   ffgh
   ffij

   Enter move: cl1   (* move piece "c" to the (l)eft one (1) location *)

   aabb
   cc..
   ddee
   ffgh
   ffij

   Enter move: eu1

   aabb
   ccee
   dd..
   ffgh
   ffij

   Enter move: gu1

   aabb
   ccee
   ddg.
   ff.h
   ffij

   Enter move: gr1

   aabb
   ccee
   dd.g
   ff.h
   ffij

   Enter move: iu2

   aabb
   ccee
   ddig
   ff.h
   ff.j

   Enter move: fr1

   aabb
   ccee
   ddig
   .ffh
   .ffj

   The board is solved!

Since the 2x2 ``f`` piece is in the final location, the board is solved.
(Of course, most puzzles will require many more moves than this.)


Part A: The ``Klotski`` module
------------------------------

The code for this section will be written in the file ``klotski.ml``.
You have to write six functions. None of them require more than 25 lines
of code in all (including helper functions), and most can be done in
fewer lines.

The Klotski board representation is described in the "OCaml notes" section.
Please read it if you haven’t already,
because you will need to know it to write these functions.
In the ``klotski.ml`` file, Klotski boards have the type ``t``.

The value of each function in points is noted in bold after the start of
each function’s description.


Board locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Locations are represented by the ``loc`` type which is just an alias for
a 2-tuple of ``int``\ s. Locations are ``(<row index>, <column index>)``
tuples, where the indices start at 0. So location ``(0, 0)`` is the
upper-left corner (row 0, column 0), location ``(0, 1)`` (row 0, column
1) is one to the right of ``(0, 0)``, and location ``(1, 0)`` (row 1,
column 0) is one down from ``(0, 0)``.


1. ``is_solved``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[**2 points**]

Write a function called ``is_solved`` that takes as its only argument a
Klotski board and returns ``true`` if the board is solved, or ``false``
otherwise. A board is considered solved if there is a 2x2 piece on the
board which occupies the four locations in the bottom two rows and the
two center columns. This function can be written in a couple of lines.
*Hint*: use the ``equal`` function from the ``Set.S`` module type and
the ``exists`` function from the ``Map.S`` module type.


2. ``compare``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[**3 points**]

Write a function called ``compare`` that takes two arguments, both of
which are Klotski boards. It returns an ``int`` which represents whether
the two boards are "equal", or one of the two is "greater" than the
other. If the two boards are equal, return ``0``. If the first board is
greater than the second, return ``1``. If the second board is greater
than the first one, return ``-1``.

The two boards are considered to be equal if:

* the set of unoccupied locations is the same for both boards

* the set of pieces are the same for both boards

To compare the sets of pieces, use the ``LocSetSet`` module we’ve
provided for you. A value of type ``LocSetSet.t`` is a set of set of
locations, so a set of pieces can be a value of this type, since pieces
are represented as sets of locations. In the board, the pieces are
stored in a ``CharMap.t`` value, which maps character labels to pieces.
Be aware that the character labels of the pieces are not important in
the comparison; if the pieces had different labels two boards would
still be equivalent as long as the same kinds of pieces occupied the
same locations. You can extract the pieces from the ``CharMap.t`` value
using the ``CharMap.bindings`` function.

You can use the ``compare`` functions of ``LocSet`` and ``LocSetSet`` to
compare sets and sets of sets respectively. This will not only compare
values for equality but will also do the right thing if the two values
are not equal (return ``-1`` if the first is smaller than the second, or
``1`` if the first is larger than the second).

To be absolutely clear: for the ``compare`` function to return ``0``,
both boards must have the same set of unoccupied locations and the same
set of pieces (though the piece labels are irrelevant). The criteria for
the boards to be "less than" or "greater than" each other is less
critical, except that for any two unequal boards, if ``compare b1 b2``
gives the result ``-1``, then ``compare b2 b1`` *must* give the result
``1``. In other words, ``compare`` must be a true ordering on the
boards.

This function is also quite short. It’s important to get this right,
because if you don’t, your ``search`` function in part B will either be
incredibly slow or won’t work at all.

.. note::

  Be aware that you do not have to call this function *at all* in your
  own code! The *only* reason for this function to exist is to make
  Klotski boards orderable, which means you can make sets of boards
  (because the implementation of sets requires that their elements be
  orderable). So don’t feel like you are doing something wrong if you
  don’t call this function in your code; in fact, you are doing
  something wrong if you *do* call this function in your code.


3. ``remove``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[**3 points**]

Write a function called ``remove`` that takes two arguments:
a character (which is a piece label) and a board.
It removes the piece with the given character label
from the ``pieces`` map of the board,
updates the ``unoccupied`` set
by adding the locations of the piece to that set,
and returns the resulting board.
If the piece isn’t on the board, the board is returned unchanged.

Again, this is a very short function. You may find the ``union``
function on sets to be useful here.

4. ``add``
~~~~~~~~~~

[**3 points**]

Write a function called ``add`` which takes two arguments:

- a two-tuple representing a piece. This consists of a character label
  and a set of locations that the piece occupies.

- a Klotski board

It places the piece on the board if possible, updates the ``unoccupied``
set, and returns the new board. If the piece is already on the board or
can’t be placed on the board because some of its locations are occupied
by other pieces, return ``None``. If the piece can be placed, return
``Some <new board>``, where ``<new board>`` is the resulting board.

Note that the new piece can only be placed on the unoccupied locations
on the board.

This is another short function. The ``subset`` and ``diff`` functions of
sets may be useful to you here.


5. ``make_move``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[**5 points**]

Write a function called ``make_move`` which takes two arguments:

* a three-tuple representing a move. This consists of a character (a
  piece label), a direction (one of ``Up``, ``Down``, ``Left`` or
  ``Right``), and an ``int`` representing how far to move the piece
  (this should be at least 1).

* a Klotski board

It returns ``None`` if the move can’t be made for any reason (including
if the labeled piece is not on the board, or if the move distance is
less than 1). Otherwise, it makes the move on the board, updates the
character/piece map and the unoccupied set, and returns
``Some <new board>``.

This function is a bit harder and a bit longer than the previous ones.
You may find the ``map`` function on sets to be useful; this is like
``List.map`` except for sets |ie| it applies a function to every value
in a set.

Be careful! It’s not hard to remove a piece from a board, get the piece
locations, move them in some direction, and add the piece back to the
board, but this won’t be enough in all cases. You also have to make sure
that the piece doesn’t go *through* any other pieces when it moves. This
is especially important for large moves |eg| moving a 1x1 piece 4
locations up or down. One way to deal with this is to only allow a move
of distance ``n`` if you would also allow a move of distances ``n-1``,
``n-2`` …​ ``1``.

Helper functions are your friend here. The ``add`` function you just
defined above will also be very helpful.


6. ``next``
~~~~~~~~~~~

[**4 points**]

Write a function called ``next`` which takes a single argument (a
Klotski board). It figures out all possible moves on the board, makes
all the moves starting from the board, collects all the resulting boards
into a list and returns the list.

To give a very simple example: consider this board (represented here as
a 2d array of characters, which is not how we are doing it in the
program):

.. code-block:: text

   .aa.
   .aa.
   ....
   ....
   ....

The following list of boards would be returned by this function (again
representing boards as 2d character arrays, which isn’t accurate, but
you get the idea):

.. code-block:: text

   aa..
   aa..
   ....
   ....
   ....

   ..aa
   ..aa
   ....
   ....
   ....

   ....
   .aa.
   .aa.
   ....
   ....

   ....
   ....
   .aa.
   .aa.
   ....

   ....
   ....
   ....
   .aa.
   .aa.

So the result will be a list of 5 boards, each of which could be derived
from the input board by moving the ``'a'`` piece in some direction by
some number of squares.

This function is a bit tricky. It’s also the most critical function for
the ``search`` function in part B. However, it doesn’t have to be that
long (we did it in less than 25 lines). The basic idea is this. Imagine
if, for a particular piece on the board and a particular direction, you
could compute all the possible moves with that piece in that direction
and could collect all the resulting boards. Do that for all directions
and for all pieces, and collect up all the boards. You can use the
``make_move`` function you defined above to make your life easier, but
you don’t have to. Once again, make sure you aren’t moving a piece
through another piece or on top of another piece.

You may find the ``List.concat`` and ``List.map`` functions to be
useful, or you can combine them with the ``List.concat_map`` function.


Part B: The ``Search`` module
-----------------------------

The code for this file will be written in the file ``search.ml``. You
only have to write one function in this section, and it can be written
in less than 25 lines (including helper functions). The goal of this
module is to allow you to start with a Klotski board and find a solution
to the board. The solution will be a list of all the boards leading up
to the final one (which has the 2x2 piece in the target location). In
fact, the solution will be in reverse order, with the last board at the
front of the list.


Breadth-first and depth-first search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code for this section is not hard to write, but you have to
understand the breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms.

References:
`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search>`__ for
breadth-first search;
`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search>`__ for
depth-first search.

Finding an optimal solution to a puzzle game like Klotski is an example
of a *tree search* problem. Trees come up all the time in computer
science. We can consider the starting board of a Klotski puzzle as the
root node of a tree. The moves that can be made on the starting board
can be applied to that board to generate new boards which are the
"children" of the root node, and each of them can then generate more
boards which are their children, and so on. A tree representing a
Klotski puzzle is actually of infinite depth, because you can move the
same piece back and forth as often as you want. However, it’s useful
when solving to stipulate that you can’t have two boards (nodes) in the
tree which are identical; this makes the tree finite and thus makes it
feasible to search for a particular board configuration (like one in
which the 2x2 piece is in the bottom two rows and the middle two
columns).

The two most basic algorithms for doing a tree search are known as
"depth-first search" (also known as DFS) and "breadth-first search"
(also known as BFS). Let’s see how they work.

The idea in depth-first search is to start at the root node, then (if
that node isn’t a solution to the problem), generate all its child
nodes, pick one of the child nodes, inspect it to see if it solves the
problem, then (if not) generate *its* child nodes, pick one of its child
nodes (grandchild of the root node), inspect it, and so on until you
eventually reach a node that has no children (perhaps because all of its
actual children have already been visited, and so are ineligible for
searching). At that point, you back up to the parent node of the current
node, pick a different child node, and continue. In this way, you will
eventually visit all the nodes in the tree. Basically, you search as far
as possible down one branch of the tree before you back up and search a
different branch. The Wikipedia article
`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search>`__ has a
picture which illustrates the order in which nodes are visited in DFS.

In contrast, in breadth-first search, you search the entire tree level
by level. First, you check the root node, then you check each of its
children, and only then each of the children’s children, and so on.
Again, you should eliminate any nodes that are the same as nodes already
seen in order to speed up the search. The Wikipedia article
`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search>`__ has a
picture which illustrates the order in which nodes are visited in BFS.

For the Klotski problem, BFS has a tremendous advantage over DFS: the
first solution found using BFS is guaranteed to be the optimal solution
of a board (in the sense of requiring the fewest number of moves).
That’s because the number of moves it takes to get to a particular board
node from the root board node is equal to the depth of the tree at that
point; put differently, each new level of the tree corresponds to
another move in the solution. So if there were a better solution in the
tree by the time you find one solution, you would already have seen it,
so the first solution found is the optimal one. In contrast, DFS will
usually not find an optimal solution, as you will see below.

A really amazing fact is that BFS and DFS can both be implemented in
terms of simple data structures which can have exactly the same
interface. DFS is naturally implemented in terms of a *stack*, which is
a data structure where you push values into the stack and pop them off
the stack, and the first value popped off the stack is the last value
pushed onto the stack. This is called a LIFO data structure, for "Last
In, First Out". From the perspective of a tree search, using a stack
works like this:

* Start with the root node (original board). Push it onto the stack.

* Repeat the following steps:

  *  Pop the first node off the stack. Check to see if it solves the
     problem. If so, you win!

  *  Otherwise, generate all its child nodes and push them onto the
     stack *as long as none of them have ever been pushed onto the
     stack before*.

* If the stack empties out before a solution is found, there is no
  solution.

For BFS, the process is exactly the same except that you use a *queue*
instead of a stack to store the nodes. A queue is like a stack except
that instead of "Last In, First Out" a queue is "First In, First Out" or
FIFO (like a line for movie tickets). That is literally the only
difference, but it means that pushing a node onto the queue puts it at
the back of the queue, not the front, so all the other child nodes that
were generated earlier will be inspected before the pushed node. In
contrast, popping a node off the queue pops off the front of the queue
(which is the same as for a stack). This difference is enough to change
DFS into BFS. Pretty cool!

There are two additional wrinkles to the tree searching process. The
first is that (as mentioned) we take care to not push nodes onto the
stack/queue if they have already been inspected before. The second is
that we don’t just want to find a solution board; we want to find the
entire *history* of the solution (the sequence of boards leading to the
solution). The way we will do this is a bit clever. Instead of storing
individual boards on the stack or queue, we will store lists of boards,
where a particular list represents the history of boards leading to the
current board. For convenience, we store it in reverse order, so that
the first board in the list is the last board in the history. So if a
board list is ``[board3; board2; board1]``, this represents a history
where the original board was ``board1``, then ``board2`` is a child of
``board1`` (generated by making one move on ``board1``) and ``board3``
is a child of ``board2``. We generate new histories by taking the head
of the list, generating a list of child boards, and for each child
board, putting it at the front of the list. So if ``board3`` has three
children: ``board4a``, ``board4b``, and ``board4c`` (representing three
possible moves on ``board3``), the new histories will be:
``[board4a; board3; board2; board1]``,
``[board4b; board3; board2; board1]``, and
``[board4c; board3; board2; board1]``. Each of these will get pushed
onto the stack/queue. When we pop a history off the stack/queue, we will
look at the head of the list (the most recent board in the history) to
see if it solves the problem; if not (and if it hasn’t been seen
before), we generate new histories, push them back onto the stack/queue,
and continue. Once we find a board which is a solution, we will also
have all the boards that led to that solution, so it’s easy to print out
the solution.


The ``Storage`` module type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file ``search.ml`` defines a module type called ``Storage`` which
represents the data structure that will store the board histories. It
will be either a stack or a queue. Here is the definition:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   module type Storage =
     sig
       type 'a t
       exception Empty

       val create : unit -> 'a t
       val push : 'a -> 'a t -> unit
       val pop : 'a t -> 'a
       val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
     end

This means that any module that has this module type defines a type
``t`` which is polymorphic (|ie| you can store any kind of data in the
type ``t``). You create a new data structure of type ``t`` by calling
the ``create`` function with a unit argument:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   let storage = create () in ...

You push a new value onto the data structure using the ``push``
function:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   push new_history storage

*Note*: These data structures can’t overflow.

You pop a value off the data structure using the ``pop`` function:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   let next_history = pop storage in ...

You can check if the storage is empty using the ``is_empty`` function.
If you pop an empty data structure, the ``Empty`` exception will be
raised.

Remarkably, the ``Stack`` and ``Queue`` modules which are part of the
OCaml standard library both implement the ``Storage`` module type. We’ll
see how to use this below.

Note that the ``Storage`` module type defines an *imperative* storage
data structure. That’s why ``push`` and ``pop`` don’t return an updated
value of type ``'a t``; instead, they mutate the input value of that
type. Both the OCaml ``Stack`` and ``Queue`` modules implement
imperative data structures. This is the only use of imperative
programming in this assignment.


Code to write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[**10 points**]

Write the ``search`` function in the ``Search`` functor.

The ``Search`` functor looks like this:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   module Search (S : Storage) (D : Domain) =
     struct
       module DS = Set.Make(D)

       let search init = ...

       let show_history hist = (* code supplied for you *)
     end

and you have to fill in the code marked ``...``. The ``Storage`` (``S``)
argument will either be the OCaml ``Stack`` or ``Queue`` module
(depending on whether you want DFS or BFS searching). The ``Domain``
(``D``) argument will be the ``Klotski`` module you defined in part A in
the file ``klotski.ml``. See below for how this code will actually be
used. The ``DS`` module will be a set of Klotski boards; these will be
used to make sure we don’t push a board history onto the stack or queue
whose most recent board has already been seen. Note that the ``compare``
function in the ``Klotski`` module that you wrote in part A is
incredibly important here! Without it, you couldn’t create a set of
boards because the ``Klotski`` module wouldn’t implement the
``Ordered_type`` module type. If you don’t implement it correctly (the
way we described above) you could still create a set of boards but the
tree search may be incredibly slow (because there are too many distinct
boards).

The ``search`` function takes one argument, which is the starting board.
It will perform a tree search starting from that board. If it finds a
solution, it will return a board history (a list of boards in reverse
order, with the final board at the head of the list). If it doesn’t find
a solution, it will raise the ``Not_found`` exception.

Here’s an outline of the algorithm to use:

* Create a new ``Storage`` structure (using ``S.create``).

* Create a history which is just a list containing the initial board.
  Push it onto the storage structure.

* Create an empty set of visited boards (using ``DS.empty``).

* Repeat the following steps:

  *  If the storage structure is empty, the search has failed, so raise
     the ``Not_found`` exception.

  *  Otherwise, pop a history off the storage structure. Then:

     *  Check the most recent board in the history. If it has already
        been seen (use the set of visited boards to check for this),
        throw the history away and go to the next one.

     *  Otherwise, check to see if the board solves the problem. If so,
        return the history and you’re done!

     *  Otherwise, add the board to the set of visited boards, find the
        children of the current board (using the ``D.next`` function,
        which will actually be the ``next`` function you wrote in part
        A), generate the new histories, and push them back onto the
        storage structure. Then continue.

Remember that in this function you need to use the correct module prefix
to use functions from the ``S`` module (of module type ``Storage``) and
the ``D`` module (of module type ``Domain``), so instead of ``create``,
``push``, ``pop`` |etc| from module ``S`` it’s ``S.create``, ``S.push``,
``S.pop`` |etc| and instead of ``is_solved``, ``compare``, ``next`` from
module ``D`` it’s ``D.is_solved``, ``D.compare``, and ``D.next``.

As usual, it’s OK to write helper functions. You may find the
``List.iter`` function useful.


How the ``Search`` functor is used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even if you’ve implemented the ``Search`` functor correctly, you may be
confused as to how it is actually used. For that, look at the
``solve.ml`` file. It has this code:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   open Klotski
   open Search

   module DFS = Search(Stack)
   module BFS = Search(Queue)
   module K_DFS = DFS(Klotski)
   module K_BFS = BFS(Klotski)

   let search_and_print search show b =
     let h = search b in
       begin
         print_newline ();
         print_string (show h);
         Printf.printf "Solution in %d moves.\n\n" (List.length h - 1)
       end

   (* ... using depth-first search with initial board b ... *)
      search_and_print K_DFS.search K_DFS.show_history b

   (* ... using breadth-first search with initial board b ... *)
      search_and_print K_BFS.search K_BFS.show_history b

We create two functors called ``DFS`` and ``BFS`` by partially
instantiating the ``Search`` functor (OCaml lets you do this!), giving
it a ``Stack`` or a ``Queue`` module argument, respectively (these
modules are part of OCaml’s standard library). Then we use those
(single-argument) functors to generate the ``K_DFS`` and ``K_BFS``
modules, which provide the code needed to solve the Klotski problem
using depth-first search or breadth-first search, respectively. Note
that we could instead have created ``K_DFS`` and ``K_BFS`` directly like
this:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   module K_DFS = Search(Stack)(Klotski)
   module K_BFS = Search(Queue)(Klotski)

Then we use ``K_DFS.search`` to search for the solution using DFS or
``K_BFS.search`` to search using BFS. We use ``K_DFS.show_history`` or
``K_BFS.show_history`` to display the solution (these are actually the
same).

This is a nice illustration of how using functors can decompose code
along natural boundaries. If we had a new problem that could be solved
using a tree search, we could use the exact same ``DFS`` and ``BFS``
modules as those given above to solve it. We would simply have to create
a new ``Domain`` module representing the problem like we did for the
Klotski problem, and pass it to the ``DFS`` or ``BFS`` functor to
generate a module that could do the searching and display the solution.

The ``show_history`` function defined in the ``Search`` module will be
used as the ``show`` argument in the ``search_and_print`` function.


Running the board solver
------------------------

We saw above how to run the interactive Klotski program. However, for
some of the boards (|eg| boards 5-7), the minimum number of moves to
solve the board is so large that it’s not really reasonable to expect a
human to be able to do it. Therefore, let’s use computers! Once all the
code above has been written, type ``make`` to compile the
``klotski_solve`` program. You can run it like this:

.. code-block:: text

   $ ./klotski_solve 0

and it will solve board 0 and print out the solution, like this:

.. code-block:: text

   $ ./klotski_solve 0

   aabb
   .cc.
   ddee
   ffgh
   ffij

   ff.h
   ff.j

   ----

   ccee
   ddig
   .ffh
   .ffj

   Solution in 6 moves.

At the end, the program prints out how many moves the solution took. You
can run the solver on any board from 0 to 7.

To time the solver, you can run the program like this:

.. code-block:: text

   $ /usr/bin/time ./klotski_solve 7

   [... solution omitted ...]

   Solution in 150 moves.

           5.31 real         5.28 user         0.03 sys

This means that the solver took just over 5 seconds to find the
solution.

By default, the board solver uses a breadth-first search algorithm to
find the optimal solution (|ie| the one requiring the fewest moves). You
can alternatively use depth-first search by adding the ``-dfs``
command-line argument, but don’t expect a good result! For instance:

.. code-block:: text

   $ ./klotski_solve -dfs 0

   [... solution omitted ...]

   Solution in 1334 moves.

It sure looks like breadth-first search is the way to go for this
problem.

.. note::

   Don’t worry if your program doesn’t give the exact same number of DFS
   moves as reported here. DFS is not guaranteed to give the minimum
   number of moves (as you can see), and the exact number of moves
   depends on the details of how the search is set up (notably, the
   ordering of the boards when generating the next boards from a
   particular board).


Efficiency of the board solver
------------------------------

For full marks, the board solver should be "reasonably efficient". This
means that, **when compiled to native code**, none of the boards should
take more than (say) 30 seconds to solve. Note that to compile to native
code you have to type

.. code-block:: text

   $ make solve_native

You can also run the solver when it’s compiled to byte code, but it will
take a long time on the harder boards. Our solver (compiled to byte
code) took 45 seconds on board 7, or about 9 times as long as the native
code version.
