Introduction
============

Welcome to CS 4!
----------------

This book serves as the official course notes, so that lectures are less of a
brain dump of details and more an opportunity to interactively go through
course topics, answer questions, and get you thinking about the material.
In addition, we will be posting most of the course-related content in these
pages, including:

* the course :doc:`syllabus <admin/Syllabus>`
  (which you should read as soon as possible!)
* administrative details
* instructions on how to set up your computer with the course software
* assignments
* coding notes and tips
* readings on particular topics

and anything else we consider useful.  Your feedback on these notes will be
very helpful to us in improving them, so please let us know if anything is hard
to understand or if something that should be here isn't.

Course-related material we won't post here includes:

* lecture slides
* code supplied to students for assignments
* some administrative information |eg| contact information

These will be posted on the course Canvas page in the Modules section.


Instructor and course staff
---------------------------

The course instructor is Mike Vanier (mvanier@cms.caltech.edu).

The TAs are listed in the syllabus.  Their contact information
will be posted on the course Canvas page.


What this course is about
-------------------------

This course is officially titled "Fundamentals of Computer Programming",
but that's a vague name that says basically nothing about what the course is
about.  What this course actually is is an introduction to functional
programming using the OCaml_ programming language.

More importantly, this is a course on teaching you a new, better, and more
enjoyable way of programming. [1]_
What this means will be fleshed out in the lectures and in the assignments.

This course will be a bit disorienting and even mind-bending at times,
but our primary goal is to expose you to new ideas, new ways of programming,
and for you to have an enjoyable time learning.  If you aren't having fun,
we aren't doing our job right, so let us know what you don't like so we
can improve it!

For more general information about the course,
please read the :doc:`Motivation` and :doc:`History` pages.
