Preamble
========

* This exam is due Saturday, February 18th, at 2 AM. Please submit your
  text answers electronically as the `CodePost <https://codepost.io>`__
  assignment called ``Midterm``.

* The exam will cover the material in the course up to lecture 12.

* There is *no time limit* on this exam, except that it must be handed
  in on time.

* This is an *open-book* exam. You may consult either or both of the
  textbooks.

* This is an *open reference* exam, with this exception: you may not
  search for or use specific solutions of the exam problems you find
  online or in a book, in a previous year’s exam written by another
  student, or anywhere else, however unlikely it may be that you would
  find such a thing.  **Honor Code rules apply.**

* This is an *open interpreter/compiler* exam. Specifically, you are
  allowed to use OCaml to develop and debug your code (and we **very
  strongly** recommend that you do this).

* This is a *no-collaboration* exam. Do not discuss the exam with
  anyone (verbally or in writing) before the due date, even if you have
  both turned in your exams already. You are also forbidden to discuss
  the exam on internet forums. **Honor code rules apply.** The only
  exception is to request a clarification of some point in the exam
  (see below).


Code
----

The code base for the midterm is located on the course Canvas site
(in the Modules section, Assignments module) as ``midterm.zip``.


Formatting
----------

Here is how your exam should be formatted. Note that **we will deduct a
significant proportion of your midterm grade (up to 1/4 of the total
grade) if you violate any of these rules.** If you have any questions
about these rules, contact us before starting the exam and we’ll clarify
them.

* Your midterm exam should all be in a *single plain text file* called
  ``midterm.ml`` (that *exact* name, lower case).

* You should write your full name and your Caltech email address in an
  OCaml comment at the top of the file, like this:

  .. code-block:: ocaml

     (* name: <your name here> *)
     (* email: <your Caltech email address here> *)

* Make sure that your file is a plain text file! Check this by typing
  the following at a Unix terminal prompt before submitting your exam:

  .. code-block:: text

     $ more midterm.ml

  If it prints out your file in a readable manner, it’s plain text.

* Write the file as a file of OCaml code. Any questions that require
  non-code answers should have these answers written as OCaml comments.

* *Make sure* that all of the lines in your midterm file have **no more
  than 80 characters in a line**.

* The exam will receive a floating-point score between ``0.0`` and
  ``20.0``, based on your performance across all of the problems.
  **There is no min grading or rework.**

* If you hand in the exam late, there is a penalty of ``5.0`` marks per
  day late, unless you have the explicit permission of the instructor
  (|eg| for a health emergency).


Clarifications and bug reports
------------------------------

If you need a clarification of anything on the exam after you’ve started
writing it, you should post a private message to the instructors on the
course Piazza page. Similarly, if you find what you think is an error on
the exam (even typos), do the same. We like getting bug reports, so
don’t be shy!
