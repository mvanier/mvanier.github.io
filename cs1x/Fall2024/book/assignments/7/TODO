TODO for assignment 7
=====================

Give the input a prompt like in J/APL: maybe 4 spaces?
Or have a command to set the prompt string :)

== SCTest.java

Some students have code which gives rise to uncaught exceptions
in the test code (for example, when 'k' is input and the stack is empty).
These just cause SCTest to exit with no error message; instead, a
message should be printed, the test failure should be noted,
and the tests should continue.

The "s" command, if it fails, should discard the number being stored.
This can easily be done by first popping the number,
and then checking the register letter.
My code does this, but it should be spelled out.

Also, the s/S and l/L difference could be spelled out better,
since it wasn't obvious to some students.

== Windows EOL madness

The tests for this assignment don't work on Windows because of EOL differences.
Rather than try to fix this, I would recommend just telling students who run
Windows to use WSL for this assignment (and, ideally, for all assignments).
