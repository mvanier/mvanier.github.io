Copying another student's code verbatim or nearly verbatim (from a file, a whiteboard, a screen share or anywhere else) is not acceptable and is an Honor Code violation.  Taking another student's file and modifying it to make it look different is definitely not acceptable and is an Honor Code violation.  Consulting a printed or electronically displayed version of another student's code and referring to it while you write your own code is not acceptable either, and is also an Honor Code violation.

While we prefer that you go to one of the course teaching assistants when you need help on the assignments (it doesn't matter which one), we don't forbid you from seeking help from other students or offering your help to other students.  However, we do insist on some guidelines to make the process fair for everyone.</p> <p>When you are helping another student with their homework, you are acting as an unofficial teaching assistant, and thus you must behave like one.  A teaching assistant will not just tell you the answer or dictate code to you; he/she will help you work through the problem so that you understand what you are doing wrong.  If you don't have the time or the inclination to do this, do not assist other students.  If you just give them your code, you are violating the Honor Code and both you and the people you are giving the code to may be in for some serious consequences.</p> <p>As a way of clarifying the way in which you can help other students (especially when it comes to debugging their code), we want you to obey the \"50 foot rule\". This rule states that if you help another student with their programming problems (including debugging), you must not consult your own code while doing so.  Specifically, we ask that your own code be at least 50 feet away i.e. not visible to you or the person you are helping while you are helping them.  (It doesn't have to be exactly 50 feet; the point is that you can't see your code while helping the other person, and you shouldn't run back and forth between your computer with your code and the computer of the person you're helping.) The slogan of the 50-foot rule is: \"Help them with your brain, not with your code.\"  Please do not try to find a loophole kind of way around this e.g. projecting your code on a building 50 feet away; that is clearly not what we mean.  Posting your code on a pastebin-like internet site, emailing your code to other people, sharing your screen with your code on it, printing it out, or even referring to it on your laptop while helping someone else, are all clear violations of the collaboration policy for this course.  Also, we don't want you to put your code up on a computer in a room 50 feet away from where you're helping someone and run back and forth, dictating a line at a time.  If you can't help them without consulting your code, don't help them.  Refer them to a teaching assistant. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>The 50-foot rule only applies when helping another student in person.</p> <p>Helping another student using teleconferencing software like Zoom, Skype, Discord etc. is covered below, but one aspect of it is that screen sharing is not permitted.</p> <p>We realize that it's more convenient to ask someone in your house for help than to walk all the way to the Annenberg building.

The main aspects of it are as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Write up a document describing what you want your program to do. This doesn't have to be very detailed, but it will give you a place to start.</p> </li> <li> <p>Refine that document into \"milestones\", which are descriptions of a series of working programs which do some subset of the total functionality of the program. The last milestone will be the final version of the program. Each milestone will add more features, and some will modify features implemented in the last milestone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write the program for milestone 1. Test it (formally or informally). When this is working, add the features of milestone 2, test them, and so on until all the programs are written.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In this assignment, we will be giving you the milestones, so you are only responsible for the last step.</p> <p>For this assignment only, we are going to force you to write and submit separate programs for each milestone. So instead of one program (<code>TicTacToe.java</code>) you will write five programs: (<code>TicTacToe1.java</code>, <code>TicTacToe2.java</code>, etc. We want to see how you write code incrementally! Note, though, that this is no harder than writing just one program, since once you are finished with e.g. <code>TicTacToe1.java</code>, you will simply copy that file to <code>TicTacToe2.java</code> and continue editing. (The only thing you need to be careful of is that you change the name of the class from <code>TicTacToe1</code> to <code>TicTacToe2</code> etc.)</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For each program, only implement the features requested for that program. If you implement too much (e.g. in an extreme case, just writing the final program and copying it to the other programs) you won't get any credit for the over-implemented programs.</p> <p>In the rest of the assignments, you will only be submitting the final version of the program.

In some cases, we will spell this out, and in other cases, we won't. We expect you to make reasonable choices in the latter cases.</p> <p>For now, all methods that we instruct you to write should be <code>public</code> unless we specifically say otherwise. However, you are free to write additional methods, and those should normally be <code>private</code>. Writing an additional method is a good choice when you see you need some functionality in multiple places.

If the cell is already filled with a number, continue to the next number in the row, and if you're at the end of the row, go to the beginning of the next row. (If there is no next row, the board is solved!) Otherwise, you have to pick a number between 1 and 9. First, collect all the numbers that could be at that location.

If the board can be solved, you're done, so return.  If not, try the next number and again try to solve the resulting board.  Continue until you either solve the board, or you run out of numbers.  If you run out of numbers, there is no number that works for that board in that location, so that board is unsolvable.  In that case, clear the number from the location (fill it with a 0) and return.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Filling the location with a 0 \"unmakes\" the move. It may not be obvious, but this step of unmaking the move when no number works is critical to making the algorithm work. Think about why that should be.</p> <p>Your solving function should return a boolean value: <code>true</code> if a solution is found and <code>false</code> if not.  Returning <code>false</code> only means that a particular board is unsolvable; it may not mean that the original puzzle is unsolvable.

If you write a brute-force implementation with a single <code>println</code> call which goes on for e.g. 50 lines or more we will take marks off. You might consider writing some private helper methods.

It can fail if the cell is already filled, or if there is a row, column or box conflict. In that case, the method will throw a <code>SudokuInvalidMoveException</code> with a good error message (indicate what kind of conflict occurred (row, column, or box) and the location of the conflicting cell). If the move is valid, it will make the move and save it to an internal list (to allow undoing the move later).</p> <p>Remember that <code>Move</code> objects store the move row/column coordinates in 0-indexed form, but your error messages report errors using 1-indexed row/column coordinates.</p> <p>Ideally, you already have methods in your <code>Sudoku</code> class that can help with the implementation of this method. If not, add them in this class.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>isSolved</code></p> <p>This method tests to see if a board is solved by checking if all cells are filled with numbers. The <code>play</code> method below will validate any such solution, so this method doesn't have to do that. (Also, illegal moves aren't allowed, so if the board is full it should be a valid solution.) It returns a boolean (<code>true</code> if solved, otherwise <code>false</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>isSolvable</code></p> <p>This method tests if the board is solvable without changing the state of the board. One way to do this is to make a copy of the board representation, try to solve the board using the <code>solveBoard</code> method of the <code>Sudoku</code> class, and then restoring the original board state.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This is one situation where having direct access to the internal state of the board from the <code>Sudoku</code> class is really useful!</p> </li> <li> <p><code>undo</code></p> <p>This undoes the last move, returning the board to the state before the last move. If there have been no moves, it does nothing but print <code>\"no moves to undo!\"</code>.</p> <p>Note that for this to work correctly, you either have to store the board state after each move, or store the moves themselves. It's much more efficient to store the moves, so please do that.</p> <p>When you undo moves, make sure to decrement the move count by 1, unless there are no moves to undo.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>hint</code></p> <p>This method supplies a \"hint\" move given the current board state. It does this by checking each empty cell of the board to see if only one possible number could go there. This shouldn't involve any heavy computation; if a candidate number doesn't have a row, column or box conflict, we say that that number can go in that cell. For a particular cell, if only one of the 9 numbers can go there, that's a valid hint. There can be multiple possible hints; collect all of them and pick one of them at random. Then make the hinted move.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This is another case where there are probably one or more methods in your <code>Sudoku</code> class that will be very useful to you when writing this method.</p> <p>Note that you will need to have a random number generator to pick a random hint; don't just pick e.g. the first one or you will lose marks! The Java <code>Random</code> class is the easiest way to get a random number generator. Also, only create one random number generator per program; don't create a new one every time this method is called. (Hint: Don't create the random number generator in this method.)</p> <p>If there are no hints, return the <code>null</code> value. <code>null</code> can substitute for any object, and is used when there is no move to return.<sup>2</sup></p> </li> <li> <p><code>printCommands</code></p> <p>This method's implementation is supplied to you in the template code.

The implementation handles reading from the terminal (called <code>System.in</code> in Java), starting the interaction loop, checking if the board is solved, reading a line of input from the user, and breaking it up into an array of strings called <code>words</code>. The implementation also contains a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> statement with multiple <code>catch</code> blocks; you shouldn't have to add any more (unless we've forgotten something!).</p> <p>What you do have to add to the method (in the spot marked by the <code>// TODO</code> comments) is the code to execute the commands. After executing a command, the program should print the board and the number of moves that have been played up to that point, unless otherwise specified.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The number of moves must be correct, even after undoing moves. Undoing a move decreases the move count (the undo itself doesn't count as a move).</p> <p>Also, for some commands (like saving a board to a file) the board state doesn't change, so don't print the board in those cases.

The first two numbers are the row and column coordinates   of an empty cell on the board   (using 1-based indexing, so the first row is row 1, not row 0),   and the last one is the number to write into that cell.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The code for the move command should come after the code for the letter commands for clarity, though there is no way that they can be confused with each other.

If it's not a valid move command, throw the <code>SudokuInvalidMoveException</code> exception.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>When checking for a letter command, please use the <code>equals</code> method on strings; do not use the <code>==</code> operator, because that only checks if two strings are identical.

One of these approaches is called turtle graphics. The idea is that you are presented with a two-dimensional drawing surface, upon which an icon called a \"turtle\" is present. This could be an image of a turtle, or anything else e.g. just a point, an arrow, a triangle, etc. Ideally the turtle icon will have an orientation showing which way is \"forward\" from the perspective of the turtle. The idea is that the turtle holds a \"pen\" which can be in the up or down position. If it's up, when the turtle moves, nothing is drawn. If it's down, when the turtle moves a line is drawn which traces out the movement of the turtle. There are commands to move the pen to the up or down position, to move the turtle forward or to a particular absolute location, and to rotate the turtle by some number of degrees. With just these commands, very complex designs can be made, as we'll see.</p> <p>Turtle graphics was made famous in the Logo programming language in the late 1960s. This was a language designed to teach programming concepts to children, and it included built-in support for turtle graphics.</p> <p>The objective of this section is to write a Java \"library\" that allows us to do turtle graphics easily. One limitation is that our library won't have a turtle icon, but we can still manage to make interesting drawings.</p> <p>Libraries</p> <p>The term \"library\" is almost never given a formal definition in any programming language, but it is used informally to refer to some body of code that contains functionality that can be used outside of the library.

It was discovered by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, building on related sets called Julia sets. By \"fractal\", we mean that the shape is self-similar, so that magnifications of parts of the image of the shape resemble the full shape (though it isn't identical). We will be able to see this for ourselves once our visualizer is complete.</p> <p>The Mandelbrot set is a set, specifically a collection of points in a two-dimensional space. The two dimensional space is actually the complex plane, which is a way of representing the infinite set of complex numbers.</p> <p>Complex numbers</p> <p>If you haven't studied complex numbers yet, don't worry! You don't need to understand them to do this assignment. If you're curious, though, a complex number is a combination of a real number with another real number multiplied by the square root of -1 (which is usually called \\(i\\), which stands for \"imaginary\"). Since -1 has no real square root, the complex numbers are a superset of the real numbers. We write a general complex number as \\(x + yi\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers; \\(x\\) is the \"real part\" and \\(y\\) is the \"imaginary part\" of the complex number. (A real number is thus a complex number with an imaginary part of zero.) We can also represent complex numbers as a point in a two-dimensional space, where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the familiar Cartesian coordinates.</p> <p>Complex numbers are added and subtracted by adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately. Complex numbers are multiplied using the normal laws of algebra with the simplification that \\(i^2\\) is -1. The magnitude of a complex number with real part \\(x\\) and imaginary part \\(y\\) is \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).</p> <p>Complex numbers give rise to a huge variety of interesting mathematical applications, and you will undoubtedly encounter them again.</p> <p>To compute the Mandelbrot set, we need to have a way of determining for any complex number \\(c = x + iy\\) whether the number \\(c\\) is in the set. We do this by computing the equation \\(z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c\\) (where the \\(z_{n}\\)s are also complex numbers). Starting from \\(z_0 = 0\\), we iterate the equation repeatedly (computing \\(z_0\\), \\(z_1\\), \\(z_2\\), ...) and ask if its magnitude remains bounded or goes to infinity. If its magnitude remains bounded, the number \\(c\\) is in the set; if its magnitude goes to infinity, it isn't in the set.</p> <p>For instance:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If \\(c = 1\\), the sequence of \\(z\\) values is \\(0, 1, 2, 5, 26...\\) and it keeps on growing, so the magnitude goes to infinity. Therefore, the number \\(1\\) is not in the Mandelbrot set.</p> </li> <li> <p>If \\(c = -1\\), the sequence of \\(z\\) values is \\(0, -1, 0, -1, ...\\), from which we can see that the magnitude never goes beyond \\(1\\). Therefore, \\(-1\\) is in the Mandelbrot set.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Actually, the Mandelbrot set itself isn't that interesting to look at; if we made it into an image, it would just be a black-and-white image with e.g. black dots for all points that are in the set. To make the images more interesting, we will color-code each point based on how quickly each point goes to infinity (if it does). There are different ways to do this; a good description is given in this page. The basic idea is this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We set a maximum number of iterations that we compute per point (to prevent the computation from going on forever).</p> </li> <li> <p>For each point, we continue iterating until the point reaches an escape threshold, which is a point whose magnitude is sufficiently large that it's clear that the magnitude will eventually go to infinity if the iteration is continued forever.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each point will be associated with the number of iterations until it reached the escape threshold, or the maximum number of iterations (if it never does).</p> </li> </ol> <p>Therefore, the Mandelbrot set computation consists in taking a bunch of points in the complex plane, and computing the iteration count for all of the points. Each iteration count can be associated with a specific color based on a color map. We take a grid of closely-spaced points in the complex plane, compute their iteration counts, convert each count to a color, and generate an image.</p>"},{"location":"assignments/5/mandelbrot/#some-images","title":"Some images","text":"<p>Here are some images of sections of the Mandelbrot set.

In addition, you cannot make instances of abstract classes; you have to make subclasses of them and then make instances of those subclasses. For a <code>MouseInputAdapter</code>, the parts that represent the <code>MouseListener</code> and <code>MouseMotionListener</code> methods are not actually missing, but the provided methods simply do nothing. You provide your own implementations of methods that override the default do-nothing methods to make the program respond to mouse input in some way.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This might seem like a strange way to use abstract classes, but it works well here, because much of the time we only want to implement a small subset of all the possible listener methods (often only one). In that case, all the other methods do exist but don't do anything, which is how we would have implemented them had we written the listener class from scratch on our own.</p> <p>In our case, we want to specify the <code>mousePressed</code>, <code>mouseDragged</code>, and <code>mouseReleased</code> methods to allow us to draw a box outline on the screen for zooming purposes. <code>mousePressed</code> and <code>mouseReleased</code> are methods from the <code>MouseListener</code> interface, and <code>mouseDragged</code> is from the <code>MouseMotionListener</code> interface.

Java calls these kinds of classes anonymous inner classes. They are \"anonymous\" because the subclass has no name, and they are \"inner\" because they are created inside another class. (Here, they're created inside a method of another class, which (amazingly enough) is allowed.) This is the standard way to create listener-style classes for graphics callbacks in Java.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Anonymous inner classes are one of the oddest aspects of Java that new Java programmers have to get used to, but they are very useful in practice. There are a few subtleties when using anonymous inner classes, and we aren't going to get into them here. For this assignment, you just need to fill in the method definitions. When inside these method definitions, you are free to call methods from the surrounding class, and you'll probably want to. You can also access fields from the surrounding class.

We can define an anonymous subclass of the <code>KeyAdapter</code> abstract class to specify this method.</p> <p>Inside of the key listener methods, we can use the <code>getKeyChar</code> method of the <code>KeyEvent</code> arguments to get the key currently being pressed when this method was executed.</p> <p>Now we will describe the actual mouse listener and keyboard listener methods you need to implement. Be aware that it's perfectly OK to define extra methods in <code>MandelbrotDisplay</code> and call them from the listener methods. This can be useful in keeping the code organized. In general, it's not a good idea to have too much code in listener methods; if you can define a method outside of the listener and just call it, that may be a better design.</p>"},{"location":"assignments/6/mandelbrot2/#mouseadapter-mousepressed-method","title":"<code>MouseAdapter</code>: <code>mousePressed</code> method","text":"<p>This method is called when a mouse button is pressed (either the left or right mouse button; it doesn't care). It takes a <code>MouseEvent</code> object as its only argument and returns <code>void</code> (i.e. it doesn't return anything). The <code>MouseEvent</code> object contains information about the state of the mouse (like where the mouse cursor is).</p> <p>The <code>mousePressed</code> method should simply record the current location of the mouse cursor in fields of the <code>MandelbrotDisplay</code> object. You'll see how it's used below.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>It's also a good idea to have the program print out a diagnostic message to the terminal e.g. something like <code>mouse pressed at location (100, 567)</code>. This also applies to the other listener methods. This can be very useful when debugging. Once everything is working, remove or comment out this debugging code.</p>"},{"location":"assignments/6/mandelbrot2/#mouseadapter-mousedragged-method","title":"<code>MouseAdapter</code>: <code>mouseDragged</code> method","text":"<p>This method gets called whenever the mouse is dragged. \"Dragging\" the mouse means holding the mouse button down (we'll assume the left mouse button here) and moving the mouse cursor. Like the <code>mousePressed</code> method, this method takes a <code>MouseEvent</code> object and returns <code>void</code>. This method therefore does what it does by interacting with the surrounding <code>MandelbrotDisplay</code> object.</p> <p>What we want to happen is for a white box outline to be drawn over the image to highlight the part of the image we want to zoom in on. (You can see this in the demo videos above.) This will be done continuously as the mouse is dragged, so we will see the box as we move the cursor to the final box coordinate.</p> <p>What you have to do in this method is save the box dimensions into fields of the <code>MandelbrotDisplay</code> object, and then call <code>repaint()</code> to get the <code>paint</code> method (described below) to redraw the image with the box on it. The only subtlety is that the box you draw must preserve the original aspect ratio of the window. The way to do this is to only use the X coordinate of the mouse cursor at the moment this method is called. With this, and the start point of the box (that you recorded in the <code>mousePressed</code> method) you can compute what the Y coordinate must be to have the right aspect ratio.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This has one weird effect: when you drag the box to select a region, the Y location of the mouse cursor won't matter while you're dragging. The box displayed should always have the right aspect ratio! Again, you can see this in the demo videos.</p> <p>Remember: you are not drawing anything in this method! You are simply recording what needs to be drawn, and the <code>paint</code> method will do the actual drawing. You should call <code>repaint()</code> in this method to force repainting of the image.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Don't call the <code>paint</code> method directly! It may seem counterintuitive and indirect, but calling <code>repaint()</code> is the way that Java wants you to force repainting of the image.</p>"},{"location":"assignments/6/mandelbrot2/#mouseadapter-mousereleased-method","title":"<code>MouseAdapter</code>: <code>mouseReleased</code> method","text":"<p>This method is called once you lift your finger off of the mouse button. You do this when the box you've outlined represents the area you want to zoom in on. Again, this method takes a <code>MouseEvent</code> object as its only argument and returns <code>void</code>.</p> <p>We will add the requirement that if that box is too small in pixel distances, you shouldn't zoom (this prevents zooming when you accidentally drag the mouse a short distance). A good criterion for this is that if the X extent of the box is less than 10 pixels, don't zoom.</p> <p>If you zoom, you need to compute the new actual extent of the image (real number extent, not pixels), recompute the image, and repaint it (without a box). If not, just repaint the image (again without a box).</p> <p>Also, if you zoom, you should save the <code>MImage</code> used to generate the previous image onto the history stack for undo purposes (see below).</p> <p>Being able to zoom into interesting areas of the image is what makes this program so much fun. Every time you run it, you can find strange new corners of the Mandelbrot set to explore. There are an infinite number of such corners (literally) so you'll never run out of them! </p>"},{"location":"assignments/6/mandelbrot2/#keyadapter-keytyped-method","title":"<code>KeyAdapter</code>: <code>keyTyped</code> method","text":"<p>The <code>keyTyped</code> method should use the <code>e.getKeyChar()</code> method to get the keyboard character that was typed (as a <code>char</code>). You need to handle the characters <code>'p'</code>, <code>'q'</code>, <code>'s'</code>, and <code>'u'</code>; any other characters can be ignored. (You don't need to print an error message in that case.)</p> <p>The <code>'p'</code> character (<code>p</code> is short for \"palette\") changes the color palette and redisplays the image using the new palette. It does this by incrementing the index into the palettes array, wrapping back to <code>0</code> if there are no more palettes (so the palettes index goes 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 0 etc. as the <code>'p'</code> key is pressed repeatedly). You should see the color change immediately when you hit the key. Note that changing the palette will necessarily generate a new <code>BufferedImage</code> (the <code>bimg</code> field) but it should not generate a new <code>MImage</code> (the <code>mimg</code> field), since that doesn't change when the palette changes.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This is one reason why having the separation between <code>MImage</code>s and <code>BufferedImage</code>s is so useful. Another reason is that we can develop the code to generate <code>MImage</code>s and <code>BufferedImage</code>s separately and combine them later.  Good design is important!</p> <p>The <code>'q'</code> character exits the program immediately.</p> <p>The <code>'s'</code> character saves the current image to a file. To do this, you should display a pop-up dialog window asking for the title, add a <code>.png</code> to the title string, and use the <code>saveImage</code> method to actually save the image. Also, if the user inputs an empty string, don't save the image; just ignore it. Hint: create a <code>JOptionPane</code> object; see the methods in the documentation to get one you can use.</p> <p>The <code>'u'</code> character undoes the last zoom. For this to work, you will need to pop the history stack to get the last <code>MImage</code> stored and use it to re-create the image. (We'll talk more about this below.) Of course, if the history stack is empty, do nothing since there is nothing to undo. Hint: Write a separate <code>undo</code> method and just call it from here.</p> <p>OK, that's enough about the constructor.

The second method is in charge of converting the <code>MImage</code> into a <code>BufferedImage</code> (which is stored in the <code>bimg</code> field).</p> <p>You might wonder why you need two methods instead of combining them both into one. The answer is that when you are changing color palettes, you are preserving the same <code>MImage</code>, so you need to be able to convert the current <code>MImage</code> (the <code>mimg</code> field) into a new <code>BufferedImage</code> (the <code>bimg</code> field), which is what the <code>draw</code> method with an <code>MImage</code> argument does.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The <code>BufferedImage</code> generated will not have the box outline in it!
