Copying another student's code verbatim or nearly verbatim (from a file, a whiteboard, a screen share or anywhere else) is not acceptable and is an Honor Code violation.  Taking another student's file and modifying it to make it look different is definitely not acceptable and is an Honor Code violation.  Consulting a printed or electronically displayed version of another student's code and referring to it while you write your own code is not acceptable either, and is also an Honor Code violation. Having someone dictate code while you type isn't acceptable either.  Basically, you have to do your own work.</p> <p>Getting advice on algorithms or syntactic details of the language, or suggestions on how to debug a part of your program that isn't working, is fine.</p> <p>All of the above also applies if you are getting tutored for the course, officially or unofficially.</p> <p>All of the above also applies to student work from previous years.

While we prefer that you go to one of the course teaching assistants when you need help on the assignments (it doesn't matter which one), we don't forbid you from seeking help from other students or offering your help to other students.  However, we do insist on some guidelines to make the process fair for everyone.</p> <p>When you are helping another student with their homework, you are acting as an unofficial teaching assistant, and thus you must behave like one.  A teaching assistant will not just tell you the answer or dictate code to you; he/she will help you work through the problem so that you understand what you are doing wrong.  If you don't have the time or the inclination to do this, do not assist other students.  If you just give them your code, you are violating the Honor Code and both you and the people you are giving the code to may be in for some serious consequences.</p> <p>As a way of clarifying the way in which you can help other students (especially when it comes to debugging their code), we want you to obey the \"50 foot rule\". This rule states that if you help another student with their programming problems (including debugging), you must not consult your own code while doing so.  Specifically, we ask that your own code be at least 50 feet away i.e. not visible to you or the person you are helping while you are helping them.  (It doesn't have to be exactly 50 feet; the point is that you can't see your code while helping the other person, and you shouldn't run back and forth between your computer with your code and the computer of the person you're helping.) The slogan of the 50-foot rule is: \"Help them with your brain, not with your code.\"  Please do not try to find a loophole kind of way around this e.g. projecting your code on a building 50 feet away; that is clearly not what we mean.  Posting your code on a pastebin-like internet site, emailing your code to other people, sharing your screen with your code on it, printing it out, or even referring to it on your laptop while helping someone else, are all clear violations of the collaboration policy for this course.  Also, we don't want you to put your code up on a computer in a room 50 feet away from where you're helping someone and run back and forth, dictating a line at a time.  If you can't help them without consulting your code, don't help them.  Refer them to a teaching assistant. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>The 50-foot rule only applies when helping another student in person.</p> <p>Helping another student using teleconferencing software like Zoom, Skype, Discord etc. is covered below, but one aspect of it is that screen sharing is not permitted.</p> <p>We realize that it's more convenient to ask someone in your house for help than to walk all the way to the Annenberg building.

Assignments will include problems drawn from fields such as graphics, numerics, networking, and games.

This doesn't have to be very detailed, but it will give you a place to start.</p> </li> <li> <p>Refine that document into \"milestones\", which are descriptions of a series of working programs which do some subset of the total functionality of the program.

(The only thing you need to be careful of is that you change the name of the class from <code>TicTacToe1</code> to <code>TicTacToe2</code> etc.)</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For each program, only implement the features requested for that program.

If it's successful, it converts the string to a <code>StringValue</code> and returns it. If not, it returns <code>null</code>.</p> <p>String syntax</p> <p>In this language, strings are written with enclosing square brackets, like this: <code>[hello, world!]</code> and not like this: <code>\"hello, world!\"</code>. The reason for this is that strings are mostly used as functions: the characters in strings are generally calculator commands that can be replayed back. The square bracket syntax is more intuitive for this purpose.</p> <p>The characters in a string consist of the characters inside the square brackets, but not the enclosing square brackets themselves (much like the characters in a Java string don't include the surrounding quotes). Strings in the calculator language don't support any character escapes (like <code>\\n</code> for newline or <code>\\t</code> for tab), so you don't have to worry about that. Strings can include embedded newlines, so this is a string spanning four lines:</p> <pre><code>[this\nis\na\nstring]\n</code></pre> <p>This doesn't require any special parsing code, since you may get newline characters from the input source.</p> <p>The only other syntax rule is that internal square brackets must be balanced. So this string:</p> <pre><code>[a string with [square brackets] inside]\n</code></pre> <p>represents the string <code>\"a string with [square brackets] inside\"</code>.  Most importantly, the string doesn't end when you read the first <code>]</code> character; it ends when you read the <code>]</code> character that balances the initial <code>[</code> character. This is the only thing you need to keep track of when you are parsing strings.</p> <p>The method reads characters from the input one at a time, trying to parse a string. First, it must read the initial <code>[</code> character; if it's not there, return <code>null</code>. (Make sure to push the non-<code>[</code> character back to the input so it doesn't disappear!) Then parse characters one at a time, looking for the closing <code>]</code> character. If the input runs out before that character is found, throw a <code>ParseErrorException</code> (don't just return <code>null</code>!), because that represents an unterminated string, which is not allowed.

It's not object-oriented at all! If we wanted to write this in a more object-oriented style, we could have moved all these operations to the <code>Value</code> class, but that would have made that class a lot larger, and wouldn't provide any particular benefit. Since each <code>Value</code> object is actually one of the three concrete subclasses of <code>Value</code> (<code>IntValue</code>, <code>FloatValue</code>, or <code>StringValue</code>), each method has to inspect each <code>Value</code> using the <code>instanceof</code> operator to find out which concrete class the object belongs to.

For numeric operations, we recommend you do nested <code>instanceof</code> tests (the outer one for the first <code>Value</code>, the inner one for the second), because often you can do an operation on arguments of different types. For instance, you can add integers to floating-point numbers and vice-versa, although you can't add either of them to strings.

Therefore (unlike CS 1) we will not be teaching you \"how to program\" from scratch. Instead, we will focus on the program design process, as well as covering a number of areas that typically trip up even experienced programmers (e.g. recursion, exception handling, etc.).</p> <p>This book serves as the official course document repository. We will be posting most of the course-related content in these pages, including:</p> <ul> <li>the course syllabus   (which you should read as soon as possible!)</li> <li>the course collaboration policies   (which you should also read as soon as possible!)</li> <li>assignments</li> </ul> <p>and anything else we consider useful.</p> <p>Your feedback on these notes will be very helpful to us in improving them, so please let us know if anything is hard to understand or if something that should be here isn't.</p> <p>Course-related material we won't post here includes:</p> <ul> <li>lecture slides</li> <li>assignment code zip files</li> <li>some administrative information</li> </ul> <p>These will be posted on the course Canvas page in the Modules section.</p> <p>We hope you enjoy the course!</p>"}]}
