Copying another student's code verbatim or nearly verbatim (from a file, a whiteboard, a screen share or anywhere else) is not acceptable and is an Honor Code violation.  Taking another student's file and modifying it to make it look different is definitely not acceptable and is an Honor Code violation.  Consulting a printed or electronically displayed version of another student's code and referring to it while you write your own code is not acceptable either, and is also an Honor Code violation. Having someone dictate code while you type isn't acceptable either.  Basically, you have to do your own work.</p> <p>Getting advice on algorithms or syntactic details of the language, or suggestions on how to debug a part of your program that isn't working, is fine.</p> <p>All of the above also applies if you are getting tutored for the course, officially or unofficially.</p> <p>All of the above also applies to student work from previous years.

While we prefer that you go to one of the course teaching assistants when you need help on the assignments (it doesn't matter which one), we don't forbid you from seeking help from other students or offering your help to other students.  However, we do insist on some guidelines to make the process fair for everyone.</p> <p>When you are helping another student with their homework, you are acting as an unofficial teaching assistant, and thus you must behave like one.  A teaching assistant will not just tell you the answer or dictate code to you; he/she will help you work through the problem so that you understand what you are doing wrong.  If you don't have the time or the inclination to do this, do not assist other students.  If you just give them your code, you are violating the Honor Code and both you and the people you are giving the code to may be in for some serious consequences.</p> <p>As a way of clarifying the way in which you can help other students (especially when it comes to debugging their code), we want you to obey the \"50 foot rule\". This rule states that if you help another student with their programming problems (including debugging), you must not consult your own code while doing so.  Specifically, we ask that your own code be at least 50 feet away i.e. not visible to you or the person you are helping while you are helping them.  (It doesn't have to be exactly 50 feet; the point is that you can't see your code while helping the other person, and you shouldn't run back and forth between your computer with your code and the computer of the person you're helping.) The slogan of the 50-foot rule is: \"Help them with your brain, not with your code.\"  Please do not try to find a loophole kind of way around this e.g. projecting your code on a building 50 feet away; that is clearly not what we mean.  Posting your code on a pastebin-like internet site, emailing your code to other people, sharing your screen with your code on it, printing it out, or even referring to it on your laptop while helping someone else, are all clear violations of the collaboration policy for this course.  Also, we don't want you to put your code up on a computer in a room 50 feet away from where you're helping someone and run back and forth, dictating a line at a time.  If you can't help them without consulting your code, don't help them.  Refer them to a teaching assistant. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>The 50-foot rule only applies when helping another student in person.</p> <p>Helping another student using teleconferencing software like Zoom, Skype, Discord etc. is covered below, but one aspect of it is that screen sharing is not permitted.</p> <p>We realize that it's more convenient to ask someone in your house for help than to walk all the way to the Annenberg building.

This is not a body of knowledge as such; instead, it's an approach to the process of software development which we consider to be valuable.</p> <p>Incremental software development is not complicated, and it's not Java-specific; you can do it in any language. The main aspects of it are as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Write up a document describing what you want your program to do. This doesn't have to be very detailed, but it will give you a place to start.</p> </li> <li> <p>Refine that document into \"milestones\", which are descriptions of a series of working programs which do some subset of the total functionality of the program. The last milestone will be the final version of the program. Each milestone will add more features, and some will modify features implemented in the last milestone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write the program for milestone 1. Test it (formally or informally). When this is working, add the features of milestone 2, test them, and so on until all the programs are written.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In this assignment, we will be giving you the milestones, so you are only responsible for the last step.</p> <p>For this assignment only, we are going to force you to write and submit separate programs for each milestone. So instead of one program (<code>TicTacToe.java</code>) you will write five programs: (<code>TicTacToe1.java</code>, <code>TicTacToe2.java</code>, etc. We want to see how you write code incrementally! Note, though, that this is no harder than writing just one program, since once you are finished with e.g. <code>TicTacToe1.java</code>, you will simply copy that file to <code>TicTacToe2.java</code> and continue editing. (The only thing you need to be careful of is that you change the name of the class from <code>TicTacToe1</code> to <code>TicTacToe2</code> etc.)</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For each program, only implement the features requested for that program. If you implement too much (e.g. in an extreme case, just writing the final program and copying it to the other programs) you won't get any credit for the over-implemented programs.</p> <p>In the rest of the assignments, you will only be submitting the final version of the program.

In some cases, we will spell this out, and in other cases, we won't. We expect you to make reasonable choices in the latter cases.</p> <p>For now, all methods that we instruct you to write should be <code>public</code> unless we specifically say otherwise. However, you are free to write additional methods, and those should normally be <code>private</code>. Writing an additional method is a good choice when you see you need some functionality in multiple places.

This allows you to run a Linux system inside of Windows. You can use this to compile your Java programs, or you can work directly from Windows, as you like. One nice thing about the VS Code editor is that it includes an integrated terminal which allows you to run terminal commands without leaving your editor.</p> <p>In addition to being able to compile and run Java programs, about the only other commands you'll need to know are those that create directories, move files between directories, and allow you to navigate between directories.
