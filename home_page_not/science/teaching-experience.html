These are listed starting with the most recent items and working backwards.

<p>I am currently teaching computer science full-time at Caltech.  I am one
of the instructors for the <a
href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/courses/cs11">CS 11</a> course (Software
Shop), which is a new course dedicated to improving the programming skills of
Caltech students and researchers.  I am also the principal lecturer for the <a
href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/courses/cs1">CS 1</a> course (Introduction to
Computation).</p>

<p>I was the teaching assistant for the <u>Methods in Computational Cellular
and Molecular Biology</u> course (Bi/CNS 169) given by Hamid Bolouri and
James M. Bower in Winter term 1998 at Caltech.  This was a combined
seminar/lab course involving a variety of approaches to simulating biology at
the cellular and molecular level.  I was mainly responsible for helping
students complete their simulation projects.

<p>I was an instructor at a short course offered by the <a
href="http://www.psc.edu">Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center</a> on parallel
simulation techniques in computational neuroscience (June 11-14th, 1997).  I
gave lectures on <a href="http://www.bbb.caltech.edu/GENESIS/genesis.html">
GENESIS</a> and on optimization methods for neural models.

<p>I was a teaching assistant at the <u> Methods in Computational
Neuroscience</u> course at the <a href="http://www.mbl.edu">Marine Biological
Laboratory</a> in Woods Hole, Mass. during the month of August for the years
1994-1996.  I instructed students on how to use the neural simulator <a
href="http://www.bbb.caltech.edu/GENESIS/genesis.html">GENESIS</a>, gave a
couple of lectures, and helped them complete simulation projects.
