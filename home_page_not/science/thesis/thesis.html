This page is for my Ph.D. thesis and related material.  It will eventually
contain GENESIS code for all the neuron and network models contained in my
thesis, as well as the a full source tree for the highly tweaked simulator
code I created and used.

<p>

Here is my Ph.D. thesis:

<ul>

<li> as a <a href="./thesis.ps.bz2">bzip2'd postcript file</a>

<p>

<li> as a <a href="./thesis.pdf">pdf file</a>

<p>

<li> as a <a href="./thesis-tex-only.tar.bz2">bzip2'd set of tex files</a>

</ul>

The original file is a postscript file; the conversion to pdf was using
<code>ps2pdf1.3</code>.  The pdf will print fine but will look horrible when
displayed using e.g. acroread (but much better using xpdf).
