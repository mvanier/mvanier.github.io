This page is the official home page for GNU shogi, a program for Unix
systems that plays Shogi (Japanese chess).  The current maintainer is me,
Mike Vanier.

GNU shogi 1.3.2 has been released!
</font>
</center>
<p>

This is a maintenance release which makes it possible to compile GNU shogi
without problems on modern Linux systems, and includes much better bitmaps
for the pieces if you are playing the large size board (which is
recommended).  The release can be downloaded <a
href="gnushogi-1.3.2.tar.gz">here</a> in gzipped tarfile format.  I invite
you to compile and run it and give me your feedback.  Compilation should be
fairly straightforward for anyone who is used to compiling programs on Unix
platforms.  I strongly recommend that you also have (at least) GNU gcc/g++
and GNU make available for the compilation process.  GNU flex and bison are
also recommended for xshogi, the current X interface to gnushogi.  All of
these GNU programs are available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu">ftp.gnu.org</a>.  If you're running Linux (which
is highly recommended :-) these programs should already be present on your
system, so you can start compiling gnushogi immediately.

You can read the <a href="gnushogi_toc.html">GNU shogi documentation</a>
online.  It is included in the 1.3.2 release, in HTML, PostScript and GNU
info format.
