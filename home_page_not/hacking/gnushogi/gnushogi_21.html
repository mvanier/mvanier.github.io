There are very few English-language books for people learning shogi.
The two I recommend are:
</P><P>

<OL>

<LI>
<CITE>Shogi for Beginners, 2nd. Edition</CITE>, by John Fairbairn.  This is a
superb beginner's book in every way, covering all phases of the game.
It was out of print for a long time, but has now been reprinted and is
available either from Kiseido (<A HREF="http://www.labnet.or.jp/~kiseido">http://www.labnet.or.jp/~kiseido</A>)
or from George Hodges (see below).
<P>

<LI>
<CITE>The Art of Shogi</CITE>, by Tony Hoskings.  This is one step up from the
Fairbairn book.  It covers a lot of ground, and is especially noteworthy
for its detailed treatment of opening lines.  You can order this book
from Amazon.com's UK branch (<A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk">http://www.amazon.co.uk</A>).
<P>

<P>

Another book you may find is <CITE>Shogi: Japan's Game of Strategy</CITE> by
Trevor Leggett.  This book is very elementary and is somewhat outdated,
having been published first in 1966.  However, it does feature a paper
shogi board and punch-out pieces, so if you want a really cheap shogi
set you might pick this book up.  It is still in print.
</P><P>

Two books that are no longer in print but are definitely worth getting
if you find them are <CITE>Guide to Shogi Openings</CITE> and <CITE>Better
Moves for Better Shogi</CITE>, both by Aono Teriuchi.  They are published in a
bilingual edition (English/Japanese) and are the only books on shogi in
English written by a Japanese professional shogi player.  John Fairbairn
did the translation from Japanese to English.

Shogi sets are available from:

George also sells equipment for all the historical shogi variants
(see section <A HREF="gnushogi_17.html#SEC17">2.4 Shogi variants</A>) (except for Kyoku tai shogi) and also sells
back issues of the magazine "Shogi" which he published for 70 issues
in the late 70's to late 80's.  This magazine is STRONGLY recommended;
it contains more information about shogi in English than you will ever
find anywhere else.

Here are some useful URLs:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Pieter Stouten's shogi page: <A HREF="http://www.shogi.net">http://www.shogi.net</A>
<DD>This is the main shogi-related site on the internet, with links to
almost all the other sites.
<P>

<DT>Roger Hare's shogi page: <A HREF="http://www.ed.ac.uk/~rjhare/shogi">http://www.ed.ac.uk/~rjhare/shogi</A>
<DD>This has lots of information, including full rules to most of the shogi
variants.
<P>

<DT>Patrick Davin's Shogi Nexus: <A HREF="http://www.vega.or.jp/~patrick/shogi/">http://www.vega.or.jp/~patrick/shogi/</A>
<DD>There's lots of cool stuff on this site; my favorite is the extensive
collection of Tsume-shogi (mating) problems, both for beginners and
more advanced players.
<P>

<DT>Steve Evans' shogi page: <A HREF="http://www.netspace.net.au/~trout/index.html">http://www.netspace.net.au/~trout/index.html</A>
<DD>Steve has written a program that plays almost all of the shogi variants,
unfortunately it only runs on Windows :-(
<P>

<DT>Hans Bodlaender's chess variant pages: <A HREF="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~hansb/d.chessvar">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~hansb/d.chessvar</A>
<DD>This page has an almost unimaginable variety of rules for different
chess variants, including many shogi variants (historical and non-historical).
