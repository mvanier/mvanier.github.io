<title>Mike Vanier: Recommendation Letters</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Recommendation letters</h1>

<p>As a Caltech lecturer/instructor, I get a lot of requests for
recommendation letters.  Here is some information that you should know if you
want me to write you a recommendation letter.  In what follows, I'll assume
that you, the reader, are the one requesting the letter of
recommentation.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>I'm generally willing to write you a letter of recommendation under the
following circumstances:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>You're a current Caltech student or recently-graduated former Caltech
student.</p></li>

<li><p>You took one or more of my courses, and did well, or:</p></li>

<li><p>You worked for me as a teaching assistant.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, it would help a lot if the position you're applying for is
one in which the material I've taught you (<i>i.e.</i> computer programming)
is relevant.  So, if you're applying for grad school in a CS program, that's
great.  If you're applying for grad school in <i>e.g.</i> a theater program,
it's not as optimal.</p>

<p>Under some exceptional circumstances, I might be willing to write a letter
of recommendation for someone who isn't in the above categories.  If you're
not sure, email me.</p>

<h2>What you can provide for me</h2>

<p>If I am going to write you a recommendation letter, I would appreciate
getting some information from you:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>All the information about the program you're applying to, including
all necessary forms, due dates, web sites, etc. as well as a description of
the program itself (or the project, if it's a summer project <i>e.g.</i> a
SURF project).</p></li>

<li><p>Your full Caltech grades transcript. <b>NOTE:</b> If you send me your
transcript, you <b>must</b> also send me <u>written</u> authorization to look at
your grades in the transcript (an email from your Caltech email address is
sufficient).  If you don't, I'm not allowed to look at it even if you send it to
me.  Rules are rules.  Naturally, I will not disclose any of the information on
your transcript to anyone, not even to the recipient(s) of the recommendation
letter.  If you want them to know your grades, you can tell them
yourself.</p></li>

<li><p>The term/dates of any course you took from me, along with the subject
(<i>e.g.</i> CS 11 python track, Spring 2012).</p></li>

<li><p>Any relevant work experience <i>e.g.</i> a programming internship.
You should describe your job in detail, emphasizing the programming-related
aspects of the job.</p></li>

<li><p>Any relevant hobby work you've done <i>e.g.</i> any open source
project you've participated in, any fun program or programs you've done,
etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Your programming experience outside of the classes you've taken with
me.</p></li>

<li><p>Any other information relating to your programming
experience.</p></li>

<li><p>Any other information you think is relevant.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You are under no obligation to send me any of this information, and I may
decide to write you a recommendation letter even without it, but the more
information you send me, the better a recommendation letter I can write, and the
more likely you are to get accepted into the program you're applying to.</p>

<h2>What else?</h2>

<p>I'm very busy, so it's possible that I'll forget about your request,
especially if you ask me far in advance of the due date.  Therefore, you should
remind me periodically (but no more than once a week).  In particular, if the
deadline is coming up and you haven't heard from me, send me an email.</p>

<p>If it's at all possible for me to submit the recommendation online
(<i>e.g.</i> by typing into a web form) then please let me know.  This is a lot
easier for me to do, and you'll get your recommendation sent out much
earlier.</p>

<p>If you ask me to write you a letter of recommendation a week before a
deadline, don't be surprised if I never write it.  To get results, ask well
in advance.</p>

<p>I don't like writing endless letters of recommendation for the same
student, no matter how good the student is.  I'm usually willing to write up
to three letters per student (time permitting, of course).  After that, I
will generally say no.  So make sure you decide which letters are the most
important ones, and get me to write those.</p>
