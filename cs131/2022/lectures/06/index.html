# CS 131:<br>Programming Languages
## _Lecture 6_:<br>The _$\mu$Scheme_ Language, part 2
---
## Today

* _$\mu$Scheme_ operational semantics

---
## Environments

* We have some good news and some bad news!

---
## Environments

* Good news:
  * In _Imp_, we had three environments<br/>($\rho$, $\xi$, $\phi$)
  * In _$\mu$Scheme_, we have only one: ($\rho$),
    which can store functions or any other _$\mu$Scheme_ value

---
## Environments

* Bad news:
  * We model environments not as<br/>(name $\rightarrow$ value) mappings
    but as<br/>(name $\rightarrow$ _location_) mappings
  * A location can store _any_ kind of value
  * We have to model a "store" $\sigma$
    which is conceptually a map from locations to values

---
## Environments

* Why bother with all this complexity?

* Recall: environments get stored inside closures (user-defined functions) at
  the moment the function is created

* You can have many different functions sharing environments or parts of
  environments

* Therefore, you can't represent environments as just (name $\rightarrow$ value)
  mappings &mdash; why not?

---
## Environments

* Therefore, you can't represent environments as just
  (name $\rightarrow$ value) mappings &mdash; why not?
  * Because updating a value should change it in _all_ functions
    that share that value's environment
  * If you just replace the entire environment in a single location,
    places that share the (original) environment won't see the changes

---
## Environments

* Thus, we have to represent environments
  as (name $\rightarrow$ location) mappings

* _N.B._ This is only necessary since variables in<br/>_$\mu$Scheme_ are mutable

---
## Environments

* OCaml itself does something different

* In OCaml, environments _are_ (name $\rightarrow$ value) mappings

* This is OK because variables in OCaml are not mutable

---
## Environments

* In OCaml, if you want mutability, you have to define
  special _mutable reference_ values

* We could have done that in _$\mu$Scheme_ too,
  but that is not how real Scheme handles environments

---
## Environments: the store

* Now that we've decided to make environments
  (name $\rightarrow$ location) mappings,
  we need to have some way to describe that in the operational semantics

* In _Imp_, environments like $\rho$ were just sets of name/value pairs

* The concept of a "location" is a bit hard to express directly in math

* So... we will do it indirectly!

---
## Environments: the store

* In addition to the environment ($\rho$),
  we will use a _store_ ($\sigma$)
  which is a (location $\rightarrow$ value) mapping

* Locations can be represented by anything (integers, addresses, _etc._)
  as long as there are an infinite number of possible locations

---
## Environments: the store

* In the environment $\rho$, a particular name is mapped
  to a location $l$ which never changes
  * So sharing the environment between functions doesn't cause any problems

---
## environments: the store

* There can be many different environments $\rho$
  (each function can have a different one),
  but there is only _one_ store $\sigma$ for the entire program

* We represent the act of mutating the value at a location
  by changing the entire store $\sigma$
  to a<br/>new store $\sigma'$ with a different value at a particular location

---
## Environments: the store

* In practice, of course, this isn't what happens
  * We use mutable datatypes<br/>(_e.g._ references) for efficiency reasons
  * But this is conceptually correct,<br/>and it keeps the math simple

---
## Environments: the store

* Another point: in _Imp_,
  expressions could alter environments by mutating variables
  * even though they couldn't add new<br/>(name $\rightarrow$ value) bindings

---
## Environments: the store

* In _$\mu$Scheme_, expressions can't alter environments _at all!_
  * because mutating variables doesn't change environments, only the store
  * _Definitions_ can still change environments, of course
  * And some expressions (_e.g._ `let`) can create temporary environments,
    which go away once the expression returns a value

---
## Operational semantics

* We will now present the operational semantics of _$\mu$Scheme_

* We will only show the operational semantics for _$\mu$Scheme_ forms
  where the semantics are significantly different from _Imp_

* Many forms (_e.g._ literals) have obvious semantics,
  so there's no need to repeat it

---
## Operational semantics: expressions

* Expression judgments all have the form
  $\langle e, \rho, \sigma\rangle \Downarrow \langle v, \sigma'\rangle$

* We see that evaluating expressions can change the store $\sigma$,
  but not the environment $\rho$

* Fun fact: compilers can compute environments at compile time,
  because they are fixed once created!

---
## Operational semantics: variables

* Here is the rule for variables:

$$
\frac{
x \in dom\ \rho
\hspace{1em}
\rho(x) \in dom\ \sigma
}{
\langle
VAR(x), \rho, \sigma
\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle
\sigma(\rho(x)), \sigma
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Var}
$$

* If $x$ is a variable in the environment $\rho$...

* and the value of $x$ in $\rho$ is a location<br/>in the store $\sigma$...

---
## Operational semantics: variables

* Here is the rule for variables:

$$
\frac{
x \in dom\ \rho
\hspace{1em}
\rho(x) \in dom\ \sigma
}{
\langle
VAR(x), \rho, \sigma
\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle
\sigma(\rho(x)), \sigma
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Var}
$$

* ...then the variable reduces to the value at that location

* ...and the store $\sigma$ is unchanged

---
## Operational semantics: variables

* Here is the rule for variables:

$$
\frac{
x \in dom\ \rho
\hspace{1em}
\rho(x) \in dom\ \sigma
}{
\langle
VAR(x), \rho, \sigma
\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle
\sigma(\rho(x)), \sigma
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Var}
$$

* (We will revise this slightly later)

---
## Operational semantics: assignment

* `set` expressions have these semantics:

$$
\frac{
x \in dom\ \rho
\hspace{1em}
\rho(x) = l
\hspace{1em}
\langle e, \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma'\rangle
}{
\langle SET(x, e), \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle UNIT, \sigma' \\{ l \mapsto v \\}\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Assign}
$$

* Evaluating the expression `<exp>` in<br/>`(set x <exp>)`
  gives a unit value and a (possibly) new store $\sigma'$

---
## Operational semantics: assignment

* `set` expressions have these semantics:

$$
\frac{
x \in dom\ \rho
\hspace{1em}
\rho(x) = l
\hspace{1em}
\langle e, \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma'\rangle
}{
\langle SET(x, e), \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle UNIT, \sigma' \\{ l \mapsto v \\}\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Assign}
$$

* We modify the store $\sigma'$ by changing the contents of the location of $x$
  ($l$) to $v$

<!-- NOTE: THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM RAMSEY, WHO RETURNS THE VALUE SET. -->

---
## Operational semantics: assignment

* `set` expressions have these semantics:

$$
\frac{
x \in dom\ \rho
\hspace{1em}
\rho(x) = l
\hspace{1em}
\langle e, \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma'\rangle
}{
\langle SET(x, e), \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle UNIT, \sigma' \\{ l \mapsto v \\}\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Assign}
$$

* We return a unit (`#u`) value

---
## Operational semantics: assignment

* `set` expressions have these semantics:

$$
\frac{
x \in dom\ \rho
\hspace{1em}
\rho(x) = l
\hspace{1em}
\langle e, \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma'\rangle
}{
\langle SET(x, e), \rho, \sigma\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle UNIT, \sigma' \\{ l \mapsto v \\}\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Assign}
$$

* (We will revise this slightly later)

---
## Operational semantics: `let`

* `let` semantics are fairly complicated:

\sigma_0 &= \sigma \\\\
@ang2a{e_1, \rho, \sigma_0}{v_1, \sigma_1} \\\\

\Downarrow

## Operational semantics: `let`

* What do `let` semantics actually say?
  * All binding expressions get evaluated to values _before_ any bindings occur
  * The store $\sigma$ can change as a result of evaluating binding expressions
  * The store resulting from one binding expression is the input to the next
    <br/>(left-to-right evaluation of binding expressions)

---
## Operational semantics: `let`

* What do `let` semantics actually say?
  * The `let` body is evaluated with the new bindings and the store resulting
    after all binding expressions are evaluated
  * The final store is the one after the `let` body evaluates
  * The environment $\rho$ doesn't change!

---

}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{LetStar}
$$

---
## Operational semantics: `let*`

* What do the `let*` semantics mean?

* For each binding:
  * Reduce the binding expression to a value
  * Create a new location in the store
  * Extend the environment with a binding
    from the binding name to the new location
  * Extend the store with the new location bound to the new value

---
## Operational semantics: `let*`

* What do the `let*` semantics mean?

* Then:
  * Evaluate the body of the `let*`
  * Return the resulting value and the new store
    * but _not_ the new environment!

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{LetRec}
$$

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

* What do the `letrec` semantics mean?
  * New locations for all bindings created in store $\sigma$
  * These locations start out with "unspecified" values
  * Environment $\rho$ extended with bindings
    from names to new locations to give $\rho'$

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

* What do the `letrec` semantics mean?
  * Binding expressions evaluated in environment $\rho'$
  * Binding expressions evaluated in store resulting
    from evaluation of previous binding expression
    (except for the first)
    * left-to-right evaluation of binding expressions

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

* What do the `letrec` semantics mean?
  * `letrec` body evaluated in environment $\rho'$
  * `letrec` body evaluated in last store extended
    with new bindings from new locations to new values
  * Return the resulting value and the new store

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

* Evaluating binding expressions can't read any of the new locations
  (with unspecified values)
  * If they do, it's a run-time error

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

* Subtle point: also cannot _write_ to any new locations
  until all binding expressions have been reduced to values
  * Again, a run-time error if this is violated

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

* Normally, all binding expressions are `lambda` expressions,
  so the problem doesn't arise

---
## Operational semantics: `letrec`

* To be completely correct, we should revise the previous rules
  for _(Var)_ and _(Assign)_ so that
  * if a $VAR$ lookup results in an unspecified value, it's an error
  * if a $SET$ binding binds to a previously unspecified value, it's an error

---
## Operational semantics: `lambda`

$$
\frac{
x_1, \ldots x_n
\hspace{0.3em}
\text{all distinct}
}{
\begin{gather*}
\langle
LAMBDA(\langle x_1, \ldots x_n \rangle, e), \rho, \sigma
\rangle
\Downarrow
\\\\
\langle
(|LAMBDA(\langle x_1, \ldots x_n \rangle, e), \rho|), \sigma
\rangle
\end{gather*}
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{Lambda}
$$

---
## Operational semantics: `lambda`

* `lambda` makes a data structure containing:
  * the formal arguments $x_1, \ldots x_n$
  * the body of the function (the expression $e$)
  * the environment $\rho$ in which the function was defined

* The store $\sigma$ is not altered

---
## Operational semantics: `lambda`

* The "banana brackets" $(| \ldots |)$ are just a notational device
  meaning "all of this is a single value"

---
## Operational semantics: apply

* User-defined function application is complicated:

<!--
(|LAMB&DA(@ang{x_1, \ldots x_n}, e_c), \rho_c|), \sigma_0
-->

$$
\small
\frac{
\begin{align*}
l_1, \ldots l_n \notin dom\ & \sigma_n \text{ (and all distinct)}
\\\\
\langle e, \rho, \sigma \rangle

\ \langle
(|LAMB&DA(\langle x_1, \ldots x_n \rangle, e_c), \rho_c|), \sigma_0

&\ \sigma_n \\{ l_1 \mapsto v_1, \ldots l_n \mapsto v_n \\}
\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma' \rangle
\end{align*}
}{
\langle APPLY(e, e_1, \ldots e_n), \rho, \sigma \rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma' \rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{ApplyClosure}
$$


---
## Operational semantics: apply

* What do the apply semantics mean?
  * First, evaluate the function expression $e$ to get a lambda form
  * Then evaluate all function arguments $e_i$
    to get values $v_i$ (and update the store(s) $\sigma_i$)

---
## Operational semantics: apply

* Then evaluate the lambda body $e_c$ in an environment $\rho_c$
  extended with bindings for all formal arguments to new locations
  * also have to extend store $\sigma_n$ with bindings from new locations to values

* Result is final value $v$ along with final store $\sigma'$

---
## Operational semantics: apply

* Implications of `lambda` and function application:

  * Each function carries around the environment it was defined in

  * All names in function mean the _same thing_ that they meant
    when the function was defined

  * Therefore the function's meaning is _independent of its context_
    * _i.e._ where it is called from

---
## Operational semantics: apply

* In addition, you can figure out _before running the code_
  where the "definition point" of every variable is
  * This is called "lexical scoping"
  * You just have to look at the text of the code
    to know where a variable is defined

---
## Operational semantics: apply

* The alternative to lexical scoping is<br/>"dynamic scoping"

* In dynamic scoping, where a function is called from
  can affect what the names in the function mean
  * Often leads to very difficult-to-track-down bugs

---
## Operational semantics: apply

* Lexical scoping thus really just means "functions behaving sensibly"

* Sounds straightforward, but took programming languages community decades
  to understand and to get right
  * ALGOL (1960!) was the first language with lexical scoping
  * Scheme was the first Lisp dialect with lexical scoping

---
## _Aside_: ALGOL

* You've probably never heard of ALGOL

* The name means <i>ALGO</i>rithmic <i>L</i>anguage

* Predecessor of modern imperative languages
  * _e.g._ Pascal, C

---
## _Aside_: ALGOL

* Designed by a (very smart!) committee
  * John Backus, Peter Naur, Alan Perlis, John McCarthy, and others

* Multiple versions
  * ALGOL 58
  * ALGOL 60 (first "real" version)
  * ALGOL 68
  * ALGOL W

---
## _Aside_: ALGOL

* Many language features originated with ALGOL
  * Use of BNF grammar to specify syntax
  * Lazy evaluation (opt-in)
    * _AKA_ "call by name"
  * Code blocks (`begin`/`end` pairs)
  * Structured programming (`for`, `while` loops)
  * `switch` statements like in C
  * Nested function definitions
  * Recursion (!!!)

---
## _Aside_: ALGOL

* Quote by Tony Hoare (inventor of Quicksort algorithm):

> "ALGOL 60 was a great improvement on its successors."

* OK, back to _$\mu$Scheme_...

---
## Operational semantics:<br/>other expressions

* We've covered the operational semantics rules
  for all the interesting/novel kinds of expressions

* Here are some of the other operational semantics rules

---
## Operational semantics:<br/>other expressions

* _IF_ rules are the same except use `#t`/`#f` instead of `0`/`1`

* _WHILE_ rules are the same except
  * use `#t`/`#f` instead of `0`/`1`
  * result is `#u` (unit) value, not 0

* _BEGIN_ rules are the same, except result of empty BEGIN is `#u`

---
## Operational semantics: definitions

* Recall: expressions can't change environments, but can change the store
  * Store = contents of environment

* Definitions can change both environments and store

* Schematically, evaluating a definition $d$ looks like
$\langle d, \rho, \sigma \rangle \Downarrow \langle \rho', \sigma' \rangle$

---
## Operational semantics: `val`

* `val` definitions conceptually split into two kinds
  * redefining a previously-defined name
  * defining a brand-new name

---
## Operational semantics: `val`

* Redefining a previously-defined name is like a `set`:

$$
\frac{
\begin{align*}
x \in d&om\ \rho\\\\
\langle e, \rho, \sigma \rangle
&\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma' \rangle
\end{align*}
}{
\langle VAL(x, e), \rho, \sigma \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle \rho, \sigma'\\{\rho(x) \mapsto v\\} \rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{DefineOldGlobal}
$$

* _N.B._ $\rho(x)$ is a location, so it can map to $v$ in the store $\sigma'$


---
## Operational semantics: `val`

* Defining a new name is a bit like a one-binding `letrec`:

$$
\frac{
\begin{align*}
x \notin dom\ \rho &\hspace{1em} l \notin dom\ \sigma \\\\
\langle
e, \rho\\{x \mapsto l\\}, \sigma\\{l \mapsto &\ \text{unspecified}\\}
\rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v, \sigma' \rangle
\end{align*}
}{
\langle VAL(x, e), \rho, \sigma \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle \rho\\{x \mapsto l\\}, \sigma'\\{l \mapsto v\\} \rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{DefineNewGlobal}
$$

---
## Operational semantics: `val`

* Q: Why do we implement `val` this way?

* A: So we can write top-level recursive functions!

* Can you think of any limitations with this approach?

---
## Operational semantics: `define`

* `define` is dead easy; it's just syntactic sugar for `val`/`lambda`:

$$
\frac{
\langle
VAL(f, LAMBDA(\langle x_1 \ldots x_n \rangle, e)), \rho, \sigma
\rangle
\rightarrow
\langle
\rho', \sigma'
\rangle
}{
\langle
DEFINE(f, \langle x_1 \ldots x_n \rangle, e), \rho, \sigma
\rangle
\rightarrow
\langle
\rho', \sigma'
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{DefineFunction}
$$

---
## Operational semantics:<br/>top-level expressions

* Top-level expressions just evaluate the expression and bind the result to `_`
  * So can desugar into a `val` with `_` as the variable name

$$
\frac{
\langle VAL(\text{\textunderscore}, e), \rho, \sigma \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle \rho', \sigma' \rangle
}{
\langle EXP(e), \rho, \sigma \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle \rho', \sigma' \rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{TopLevelExp}
$$
