Introduction
============

Welcome to CS 131!
------------------

This book serves as the official course notes, so that lectures are less of a
brain dump of details and more an opportunity to interactively go through
course topics, answer questions, and get you thinking about the material.
In addition, we will be posting most of the course-related content in these
pages, including:

* the course :doc:`syllabus <admin/Syllabus>`
  (which you should read as soon as possible!)
* administrative details
* instructions on how to set up your computer with the course software
* links to lecture slides
* assignments
* coding notes and tips

and anything else we consider useful.  Your feedback on these notes will be
very helpful to us in improving them, so please let us know if anything is hard
to understand or if something that should be here isn't.

Course-related material we won't post here includes:

* research papers of interest
* code supplied to students for assignments
* some administrative information |eg| contact information

These will be posted on the course Canvas page in the Modules section.


Instructor and course staff
---------------------------

The course instructor is Mike Vanier (mvanier@cms.caltech.edu).

The TAs are listed in the syllabus.  Their contact information
will be posted on the course Canvas page.


What this course is about
-------------------------

CS 131 is a course on implementing programming languages.
We will be implementing interpreters for several programming languages.
Some will be imperative, and some will be functional.
Some will be untyped, some dynamically typed, and some statically typed.
We will learn how programming languages differ "from the inside"
|ie| how different features of programming languages
affect the implementations of these languages.

This is an extremely interesting and fun topic,
and it's one of my personal favorite subjects.
Implementing programming languages can be very addicting,
but it is also a lot of work.
We will be using the OCaml_ language exclusively in this course.

We hope you enjoy the course!
