# CS 131:<br/>Programming Languages
## _Lecture 18_:<br/>The _Typed $\mu$Scheme_ Language:<br/>Substitution

---
## Previously

* Kinds
* Operational semantics of type checking in _Typed $\mu$Scheme_

---
## Today

* Type equivalence
* Type renaming
* Free and bound type variables
* Capture-avoiding substitution

---
## Type checking

* Assignment 5 will require you
  to write the type checker for _Typed $\mu$Scheme_

* Last time, we covered the fundamental rules
  of kind and type checking in the language

* However, there are still some important topics we didn't cover

* This lecture will give you enough information
  to actually do the assignment!

---
## Type checking

* These topics involve the way type variables work,
  and how to substitute actual types for type variables

* It may sound trivial, but there are a _lot_ of subtleties to it!

* One way that this manifests itself:
  real language implementations have often had subtle bugs
  that were related to mistakes in the substitution process

---
## Type equivalence

* Many type checking rules require the ability to check
  if two types are "the same"

* Example: the "then" and "else" branches of an `if`
  must both have the same type

* Why is this difficult to do?

---
## Type equivalence

* For many types, it _isn't_ difficult
  * Comparing two concrete types like `int` and `float` for equality
    is trivial
  * Even two (non-polymorphic) function types
    can easily be compared for equality

* In fact, as long as the type has no type variables,
  structural comparison is all you need

* When type variables exist, it becomes harder

---
## Type equivalence

* Consider these two types:
 * $\forall \alpha: \alpha \to \alpha$
 * $\forall \beta: \beta \to \beta$

* Are these "the same" type?
  * Structurally, no
  * But in terms of what they _represent_, yes!

---
## Type equivalence

* Consider these two types:
 * $\forall \alpha: \alpha \to \alpha$
 * $\forall \beta: \beta \to \beta$

* We say they are "equivalent"
  * (The technical name is (confusingly)<br/>"$\alpha$-equivalent",
    which means<br/>"equivalent modulo renaming")

---
## Type equivalence

* Consider these two types:
 * $\forall \alpha: \alpha \to \alpha$
 * $\forall \beta: \beta \to \beta$

* We will use the $\equiv$ operator to denote this kind of equality

---
## Type equivalence

* The $\equiv$ operator relates types that are "observationally equivalent"

* This means that as far as the program is concerned,
  there is no way to tell that they are different
  * You could swap one type for the other, and it would make no difference

---
## Type equivalence

* The $\equiv$ operator relates types that are "observationally equivalent"

* So it looks like the $\equiv$ relation means
  that you can rename a type variable to anything you want,
  and it doesn't change the meaning

---
## Variable capture

* One problem: not all renamings are alike!
* Consider the type $\forall \alpha : \alpha \to \beta$
* If we rename $\alpha$ to $\gamma$,
  we get $\forall \gamma : \gamma \to \beta$
  * Are these equivalent?

* What if we rename $\alpha$ to $\beta$?
  * Are these equivalent?

---
## Variable capture

* If we rename $\alpha$ to $\beta$ in
  $\forall \alpha : \alpha \to \beta$,
  we get $\forall \beta : \beta \to \beta$,
  which is a completely different type!

* We say that the (bad) renaming has _captured_ the type variable $\alpha$

* How do we avoid this?

---
## Avoiding variable capture

* We want to be able to tell if two types are "equal"
  in the sense that matters to the programs we are running
  * In other words "equivalent"<br/>(the $\equiv$ operator)

* If we can substitute the type variable names in the types
  to make them the same _without causing variable capture_, we can do this

---
## Avoiding variable capture

* We want to be able to tell if two types are "equal"
  in the sense that matters to the programs we are running
  * In other words "equivalent"<br/>(the $\equiv$ operator)

* If we do it _incorrectly_,
  we may conclude that two unequal types are actually equal
  * Like $\forall \alpha : \alpha \to \alpha$
    and $\forall \beta : \alpha \to \beta$
    after substituting $\alpha$ for $\beta$ in the latter

---
## Important points

* The specific names of type variables _don't matter_

* The purpose of a type variable is to tell you
  _where_ you need to substitute a type
  when you assign a concrete type to the variable

* **It's very important that _different_ type variables
  in a polymorphic type _stay different_,
  because otherwise you may get (type) variable capture**

---
## Important points

* In _Typed $\mu$Scheme_, type variables occur
  in both `forall` type expressions and<br/>`type-lambda` value expressions

* Some type variables are _bound_
  by an enclosing `forall` or `type-lambda`,
  while others are (locally) _free_

---
## Important points

* When we rename a bound variable,
  we mustn't rename it to something
  that will cause us to capture a free variable

* If we can rename two types *without capturing variables*
  so that they are identical, the types are equivalent

---
## Rules for type equivalence

* Obviously, this is a complicated thing to do

* We need a set of rules that will guide us to a correct implementation

* We will write these rules as inference rules
  (just like operational semantics!)

$$

$$
\label{}\tag{EquivTyRenamed}
$$

* You can rename a quantified type variable
  $\alpha_i$ in a `forall` type to $\beta$ if:
  * $\beta$ is not a free type variable in the type $\tau$
  * $\beta$ is not one of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$

\\\\
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{EquivTyRenamed}
$$

* In that case, you replace $\alpha_i$ with $\beta$
  in the list of bound type variables,
  and you replace $\tau$ with $\tau[\alpha_i\mapsto\beta]$

---
## Rules for type equivalence

* If you can rename *all* the quantified type variables
  in two `forall` types so that they are identical...
* and the "body" types $\tau$ are equivalent...
* ...then the two `forall` types are equivalent

---
## Rules for type equivalence

$$
\frac{\tau\equiv\tau'}{\tau'\equiv\tau}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{TySymmetry}
$$

* $\text{TySymmetry}$ says that type equivalence is symmetric
  * (You can also prove that it's reflexive and transitive)

---
## Type substitution

* The $\tau[\alpha_i\mapsto\beta]$ expression conceals something important

* The $\mapsto$ operator means "substitutes",
  so $\tau[\alpha_i\mapsto\beta]$ means
  "the type $\tau$,
  with $\beta$ substituted for all free occurrences of $\alpha_i$"

* So if we want to define type *equivalence*,
  we have to define what type *substitution* means

---
## Type substitution

* However, before we do that, we have to talk about a few other things first

---
## Free and bound type variables

* In a particular (type or value) expression,
  type variables can occur _free_ or _bound_

* This is a relative concept;
  if a type variable is free at the top level, it's an error

* However, at any moment during type checking,
  we may be looking at a subexpression
  which has an associated type environment $\Gamma$
  which may have free type variables

---
## Free and bound type variables

* A _bound_ type variable
  is one that occurs inside a `forall` form (type level)
  or a `type-lambda` form (value level)

* Examples:

<pre><code>;; type level
(forall ['a] ('a -&gt; 'a)) <em>;; 'a is bound</em>
(forall ['a] ('b -&gt; 'b)) <em>;; 'b is free</em>

;; value level
(type-lambda ['a] (lambda ([x : 'a]) x)) <em>;; 'a is bound</em>
(type-lambda ['b] (lambda ([x : 'a]) x)) <em>;; 'a is free</em>
</code></pre>

---
## Free and bound type variables

* Since we are dealing with type substitution here,
  we'll list the inference rules
  for determining the free type variables in a type

* You won't have to implement this, but you will need to use it!

---
## Renaming and substitution

* Free and bound variables are very important for type substitution
  because we _only_ substitute into free variables,
  never into bound variables

* This is true for both _renaming_ and _substitution_
  * Renaming: change one type variable into another type variable
  * Substitution: substitute a type for a type variable

---
## Renaming and substitution

* Free and bound variables are very important for type substitution
  because we _only_ substitute into free variables,
  never into bound variables

* Renaming is thus a special case of substitution
  * and we'll implement it that way

---
## Renaming and substitution

* If we're renaming the quantified variables in a `forall` type,
  we only rename the occurrences of these variables
  that are free in the body of the `forall`

* If we're substituting for a type variable in some type,
  we substitute only for free occurrences of that variable in the type

---
## Renaming and substitution

* You _never_ substitute into a _bound_ occurrence of a type variable!

<pre><code>;; OK to substitute into 'c, not 'a
('c -&gt; (forall ('a) ('a -&gt; 'c)))

;; OK to substitute into 'c, not 'b
('c -&gt; (forall ('b) ('b -&gt; 'c)))
</code></pre>

* Otherwise you get "variable capture" and the meaning of the type changes

---
## Renaming and substitution

* You can't rename a free variable to the same name as a bound variable

<pre><code>;; OK to rename 'c to 'b, but not to 'a
('c -&gt; (forall ('a) ('a -&gt; 'c)))

;; Renaming 'c to 'a would give:
;; ('a -&gt; (forall ('a) ('a -&gt; 'a)))
;; which is not the same type!
</code></pre>

---
## Renaming and substitution

* You can't substitute into a free variable
  an expression which *contains* a bound variable (unless you rename it)

<pre class="smaller"><code>; Substitute ('b -&gt; 'b) for 'c
('c -&gt; (forall ('a) ('a -&gt; 'c)))
; Gives: (('b -&gt; 'b) -&gt; (forall ('a) ('a -&gt; ('b -&gt; 'b))))

; Can't substitute ('a -&gt; 'a) for 'c
('c -&gt; (forall ('a) ('a -&gt; 'c)))
; Would give: (('a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; (forall ('a) ('a -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'a)))
; i.e. variable capture
</code></pre>

---
## Renaming and substitution

* It's clear that renaming and substitution are subtle,
  and there are a number of serious pitfalls
  that can easily break a type system

* As before, we will spell out the correct substitution rules
  using math notation<br/>(inference rules)

* This will give us renaming too,
  since renaming is a special case of substitution

---
## Substitution rules

* We will give the rules for substituting a single type $\tau$
  for a single type variable $\alpha$

* The more general case of substituting $n$ types
  for $n$ type variables is obtained
  by applying these rules repeatedly for each substitution

\rightarrow
\tau'[\alpha\mapsto\tau]
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{SubTyFun}
$$

* Substitute a type into a function type
  and the function type's arguments

---
## Substitution rules

* Substitution into a quantified type is for *free variables only*,
  and it may not capture a free type variable of $\tau$
  (the type being substituted):

$$
\frac
{
\alpha\notin\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\}
\quad
\text{ftv}(\tau)
\cap
\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n\}
= \emptyset
}
{
(
\forall
\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n
\\,.\\,
\tau'
)
[\alpha\mapsto\tau]
\equiv
\forall
\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n
\\,.\\,
(\tau'[\alpha\mapsto\tau])
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{SubTyForall}
$$

---
## Substitution rules

* If you want to substitute,
  but substitution would lead to variable capture,
  you can avoid capture by substituting into an equivalent type:

$$
\frac
{\tau'\equiv\tau''}
{
\tau'
[\alpha\mapsto\tau]
\equiv
\tau''
[\alpha\mapsto\tau]
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{TySubEquiv}
$$

* For instance, if $\alpha$ is a free variable in $\tau'$,
  rename $\alpha$ in $\tau'$ to something else to get $\tau''$,
  then do the substitution
