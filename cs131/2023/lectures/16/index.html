# CS 131:<br/>Programming Languages
## _Lecture 16_:<br/>The _Typed $\mu$Scheme_ Language:<br/>Operational semantics, part 1

---
## Previously

* Polymorphic types
* Concrete syntax of _Typed $\mu$Scheme_

---
## Today

* The type system of _Typed $\mu$Scheme_
* Kinds and kind formation
* Operational semantics of kind checking
* Types and type formation
* [Next time: Operational semantics of type checking]

---
## Overview

* The _Typed $\mu$Scheme_ type system has a number of interesting features:
  * Universally-quantified types _i.e._ `forall` types
  * Type variables _e.g._ `'a`
  * The `type-lambda` type abstraction form
  * The &hairsp;`@`&hairsp; type application form
  * The `val-rec` definition form

---
## `forall` types and type variables

* Types can include _type variables_

* Type variables are identifiers
  (usually single lowercase letters)
  written with a leading single quote mark (like `'a`, `'b`)
  * Don't confuse them with quoted symbols!

---
## `forall` types and type variables

* A type with type variables has to have a leading `forall` binding
  * _e.g._ `(forall ['a] ('a -> 'a))`
  * All type variables in type names need to be bound by some `forall` binder

---
## `forall` types and type variables

* A `forall` type says that the type (_e.g._ of a function)
  is valid "for all" concrete types that could be bound to the type variables
* For a particular call to the function,
  the type variables are _instantiated_
  to whatever particular type they need to be
---
## `forall` types and type variables

* We also refer to these types as
  * "universally-quantified types"
  * "quantified types"
  * or just "polymorphic types" for short

---
## `forall` types and type variables

* Example: a function that computes a length of a list
  would have the type<br/>`(forall ['a] ((list 'a) -> int))`<br/>
  because if the list has element type `'a`
  the function has type `((list 'a) -> int)`
  * Mathematically, we write this as
    $\forall \alpha\\, . \\, (list\ \alpha) \rightarrow int$

---
## `forall` types and type variables

* If applied to a list of type `(list int)`,
  the type variable `'a` becomes `int` in this case,
  and the function as a whole has type<br/>`((list int) -> int)`

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* To create an expression which has a polymorphic type,
  we use the `type-lambda` form
* This is commonly found in definitions of functions
  with polymorphic types

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* Here's the function to compute the length of a list in regular _$\mu$Scheme_:

<pre><code>(define length (lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      0
      (+ 1 (cdr lst))))
</code></pre>

* What would this look like in Typed _$\mu$Scheme_?

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* This defines a polymorphic recursive function,
  so we need to use the `val-rec` definition form instead of just `define`:

<pre><code>(<em>val-rec</em>
  ...)
</code></pre>

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* The first argument in a `val-rec` form is the return type,
  which can be a polymorphic type:

<pre><code>(val-rec
  <em>(forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))</em>
  ...)
</code></pre>

* Note that the `forall` keyword is part of the _type_ language,
  while `type-lambda` is part of the _expression_ language

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* Then we have the function name:

<pre><code>(val-rec
  (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))
  <em>length</em>
  ...)
</code></pre>

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* Then the `type-lambda` form which introduces type variables into expressions;
  these will be bound to concrete types during "type application"

<pre><code>(val-rec
  (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))
  length
  <em>(type-lambda ['a]</em>
    <em>...)</em>)
</code></pre>

* Here, there is only one type variable: `'a`
---
## The `type-lambda` form

* Then the `type-lambda` form which introduces type variables into expressions;
  these will be bound to concrete types during "type application"

<pre><code>(val-rec
  (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))
  length
  <em>(type-lambda ['a]</em>
    <em>...)</em>)
</code></pre>

* At run-time, this will be bound to a concrete type

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* Then we have the (value) `lambda` form:

<pre><code>(val-rec
  (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))
  length
  (type-lambda ['a]
    <em>(lambda ([lst : (list 'a)])</em>
      ...)))
</code></pre>

* Note that we have to spell out the type of the arguments to `lambda`
* This is the first place we use the type variable `'a` in the function body

---
## The `type-lambda` form

* The rest of the code is basically the same as the untyped version...

<pre><code>(val-rec
  (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))
  length
  (type-lambda ['a]
    (lambda ([lst : (list 'a)])
      <em>(if ((@ null? 'a) lst)</em>
          <em>0</em>
          <em>(+ 1 ((@ length 'a) ((@ cdr 'a) lst))))</em>)))
</code></pre>

* ... except that all polymorphic values/functions
  must be applied explicitly to types using the `@` type application operator

---
## The `type-lambda` form

<pre><code>(val-rec
  (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))
  length
  (type-lambda ['a]
    (lambda ([lst : (list 'a)])
      (if (<em>(@ null? 'a)</em> lst)
          0
          (+ 1 (<em>(@ length 'a)</em> (<em>(@ cdr 'a)</em> lst)))))))
</code></pre>

* Here, we apply them to the type variable `'a`
  * Forgetting to explicitly instantiate type-polymorphic values
    with `@` is the most common pitfall in this language
---
## The `type-lambda` form

<pre><code>(val-rec
  (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -&gt; int))
  length
  (type-lambda ['a]
    (lambda ([lst : (list 'a)])
      (if (<em>(@ null? 'a)</em> lst)
          0
          (+ 1 (<em>(@ length 'a)</em> (<em>(@ cdr 'a)</em> lst)))))))
</code></pre>

* Here, we apply them to the type variable `'a`
  * ("Real" languages can infer this automatically most of the time)

---
## Kinds

* We saw in _Typed Imp_ that adding a new polymorphic type (arrays)
  required changes to the abstract syntax of the language
  and new type formation rules
---
## Kinds

* That approach is not scalable;
  there are potentially an unbound number of new polymorphic types
  we might want to add
  * ultimately, want to allow users to add them as well
    (but not in this language!)

* How do we do this?

---
## Kinds

* We can consider polymorphic types as "functions from types to types"
  and make it easy to add new such functions
* To make this more precise, we introduce the notion of "kinds"
* A "kind" is a "type of types"
* Kinds classify types in the same way that types classify values

---
## Kinds

* Informally, the rules for forming kinds are pretty simple:
  * Concrete types (`int`, `bool`, _etc._) have kind `*`
  * Type constructors (_e.g._ `list`) have function kinds
    * Arguments are a tuple of kinds (often just one)
    * Result is a kind

---
## Kinds

* So `list` has the kind `* -> *` because it is a "type function"
  taking a type argument of kind `*` and returning a type of kind `*`

* A 2-tuple type (perhaps called `pair`) would have the kind
  `* * -> *`
  * because it takes a pair of two input types (_e.g._ `int` and `bool`)
  * and returns a concrete type<br/>`(pair int bool)` of kind `*`

---
## Kinds: notation

* When we write out pair kinds in equations,
  we write them as a product _e.g._ $* \times *$

* So the pair type constructor's kind is $* \times * \rightarrow *$

---
## Kinds

* More complex kinds are possible

* _e.g._ Haskell monad transformers have the kind<br/>
  `(* -> *) -> (* -> *)`,
  which means they map a unary type constructor
  to another unary type constructor

* We won't need anything that complex here

---
## Kinds

* Mathematically, we can represent kinds as follows:

$$
\large{
\kappa ::= \hspace{0.2em} * \hspace{0.5em} | \hspace{0.5em}
\kappa_1 \times \ldots \times \kappa_n \Rightarrow \kappa
}
$$

* A kind of &nbsp;`*`&nbsp; is the kind of a simple type

* A kind of
  `$\kappa_1 \  \times \ \ldots \  \times \kappa_n
   \Rightarrow \kappa$`
  is the kind of a "type function" (type constructor)

---
## Kinds

* Mathematically, we can represent kinds as follows:

$$
\large{
\kappa ::= \hspace{0.2em} * \hspace{0.5em} | \hspace{0.5em}
\kappa_1 \times \ldots \times \kappa_n \Rightarrow \kappa
}
$$

* A different way of thinking of kinds
  is to consider _all_ kinds as the kinds of type constructors
  where simple types (of kind `$*$`)
  are "nullary" type constructors (_i.e._ having no type arguments)

---
## Kind formation rules

* Abstractly, the "typing rules" for forming kinds
  ("kind formation rules") are quite simple:

$$
\frac{}{* \hspace{0.3em} \text{is a kind}}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{KindFormationType}
$$

$$
\frac{\kappa_1, \ldots , \kappa_n \hspace{0.3em} \text{are kinds}
\hskip{1em} \kappa \hspace{0.3em} \text{is a kind}
}
{\kappa_1 \times \ldots \times \kappa_n
 \Rightarrow \kappa \ \hspace{0.1em} \text{is a kind}}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{KindFormationArrow}
$$

* That's it!

---
## Kind formation rules

* Actually, these kind formation rules are more general than we will need

* In our language,
  the function kinds will always have arguments and types that have kind `*`

---
## Review: environments

* Before we go further, we should review the notion of *environment*

* We already have two environments:
  * value environment (for evaluation)
  * type environment (for type checking)

* ... and we are going to add a third:
  * a kind environment

---
## Value environment

* The "value environment" is the same as the environment used in an
  untyped language like _$\mu$Scheme_

* It consists of bindings between *variable names* and *values*

* It's used by the evaluator to assign *values* to *expressions*
  being evaluated

---
## Value environment

* (Note that _Typed $\mu$Scheme_ uses only a single value environment; 
  it doesn't split them into three parts like _Typed Imp_)

---
## Type environment

* Like _Typed Imp_, _Typed $\mu$Scheme_ will also have a _type environment_
  * represented in equations by the symbol $\Gamma$

* It consists of bindings between *variable names* and *types*

* It's used by the type checker to assign *types* to *expressions*
  being type-checked

---
## Kind environment

* OK, so what the heck is a *kind environment*?

* It consists of bindings between "type names" and *kinds*

* It's used by a "kind checker" to assign *kinds* to *types*
  during type checking

---
## Kind environment

* One difference: the "type names" are not "variable names"

* There are actually three distinct groups of "type names":
  * *base types* (like `int`, `bool`, `unit`)
  * *type constructors* (like `list`, `pair`)
  * *type variables* (like $\alpha$, $\beta$ _etc._)

---
## Kind environment

* You could consider base types as "nullary type constructors"
  (_i.e._ type constructors with no arguments) if you prefer

---
## Kind environment

* What the kind environment does is tell you which types are valid
  and which ones are not

* The kind environment is represented symbolically as `$\Delta$`

* We represent membership in `$\Delta$`
  by the notation `$\tau :: \kappa$`
  where `$\tau$` is a type constructor and `$\kappa$` is a kind

---
## Kind environment

* For instance: given this type environment:

$$
\Delta_0 = \\{
int :: *, \\ bool :: *, \\ unit :: *, \\\\
pair :: * \times * \Rightarrow *, \\\\
list :: * \Rightarrow *
\\}
$$

* Which of the following types are valid?
<div class="smaller">

  * `int`, `bool`, `unit`, `list`, `pair`
  * `(list int)`, `(pair int)`, `(list list)`, `(unit bool)`
  * `(list int bool)`, `(pair int bool)`
  * `(list (list int))`, `(pair (list int))`

</div>

---
## Kind Environment

* Advantage of having a kind environment:
  we can add new type constructors
  simply by adding them to the kind environment (no new rules!)

  * However, in _Typed $\mu$Scheme_
    the set of type constructors will be fixed<br/>(not user-extensible)

* We can also add type variables temporarily during type checking

---
## Kind Environment

* The kind environment $\Delta$ doesn't contain kinds for
  all _possible_ types...

* ... but it must be possible to _deduce_ any type's kind given the
  kind environment

* Example: `list` has kind `* -> *` and `int` has kind `*`,
  so `(list int)` has kind `*`

* Figuring out the kind of arbitrary types is _kind checking_

---
## Kind Environment

* This is analogous to type checking:

  * Type environment $\Gamma$ doesn't contain types for all possible
    expressions...

  * ... but the types of all possible expressions must be
    *deducible* from the type environment

* Actual types can be viewed as "kind expressions" in a sense

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* Now we'll present the (informal) rules for constructing types,
  assuming a kind environment `$\Delta$`

* For the purposes of these rules, we'll consider
  type constructors to be "types"

  * Essentially, anything with a valid kind is a "type"
    according to these rules

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* A type can be formed by writing a type constructor
  * including nullary type constructors<br/>(base types)

* This is valid as long as the type constructor
  is bound in the kind environment `$\Delta$`

* For instance, in the kind environment `$\Delta_0$` presented previously,
  we can immediately get the types `int`, `bool`, and `unit`

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* A type can be formed by writing a type constructor
  * including nullary type constructors<br/>(base types)

* This is valid as long as the type constructor
  is bound in the kind environment `$\Delta$`

* We can also get the type constructors `list` and `pair`

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* A type can be formed by applying a "type" (type constructor) to other types

* For instance, `(list int)` is the type of lists of integers,
  and `(pair int bool)` is the type of integer/boolean pairs

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* A type can be formed by applying a "type" (type constructor) to other types

* For a type application to be well-formed,
  the type arguments must have the right number
  and kind for the type constructor
  * So `(list int bool)` is invalid, as is<br/>`(list list)`

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* A type can be formed as a function type,
  by specifying the argument and result types

* We restrict ourselves to function types
  where the argument and result types have kind `*`
  * This is a common restriction in typed functional languages
  * Some languages (_e.g._ Haskell) don't have this restriction!

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* _Note_: Don't confuse function _types_ (the types of functions)
  with function _kinds_
  (the kinds of non-nullary type constructors like `list`)

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* So for function types, if:
  * the argument types are `$\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n$`<br/>(all of kind `*`)
  * ... and the result type is `$\tau$` (of kind `*`)
  * ... and all types are bound in (or deducible from)
    the kind environment `$\Delta$`
  * ... then the function type
    `$\tau_1 \times \cdots \times \tau_n \Rightarrow \tau$`
    is well-formed (valid)

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* We also need rules for type variables and universally-quantified types

* We stipulate that all type variables are well-formed and have kind `*`
  * We don't allow type variables
    to be instantiated with non-nullary type constructors
    like `list`, for instance

---
## Type formation rules (informal)

* A universally-quantified type (`forall` type) is well-formed if:
  * Given an initial kind environment `$\Delta_0$`
  * ... add all the type variables of the `forall` type
    with kinds `*`, and call the resulting kind environment `$\Delta_1$`
  * ... and assuming that in `$\Delta_1$` the type `$\tau$` has kind `*` too
  * ... then the original `forall` type is well-formed

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* You can see that the type formation rules get complicated pretty fast
* Fortunately, we have a secret weapon: math!

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* We'll now spell out
  the formal versions of the previous type formation rules
* For any given type,
  we deduce a _kinding judgment_ of the form
  `$\Delta \vdash \tau :: \kappa$`; this gives the kind of the given type
* Note that this only tells us which types are _valid_
  _i.e._ have valid kinds ("kind checking");
  we haven't even gotten to type checking yet!

---
## Note 1

* Note that conceptually,
  our kind environment only binds type _constructors_ to kinds

* (Although some of these are _nullary_ type constructors
  like `int`, `bool`, and `unit`)

* Think of these as the "building blocks" of types

---
## Note

* We can use type _variables_ to stand for (unknown, nullary) constructors

* We can add type variables to kind environments
  as constructors with special names,
  because type variable names
  are distinct from actual type constructor names
  * (they have to start with the quote character `(')`)
  * This is a bit of a hack, but it works

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* The type formation rules give the valid types (and their kinds)
  for any types that can be created in the language

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* In code, the types are formed using the OCaml type `ty_expr`:

<pre><code>type ty_expr =
  | TyCon        of id
  | TyConApp     of ty_expr * ty_expr list
  | FunctionType of ty_expr list * ty_expr
  | ForAll       of id list * ty_expr
  | TyVar        of id
</code></pre>

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* In code, the types are formed using the OCaml type `ty_expr`:

<pre><code>type ty_expr =
  | <em>TyCon        of id</em>
  | TyConApp     of ty_expr * ty_expr list
  | FunctionType of ty_expr list * ty_expr
  | ForAll       of id list * ty_expr
  | TyVar        of id
</code></pre>

* `TyCon` represents type constructors
  * the things that are in the kind environment

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* In code, the types are formed using the OCaml type `ty_expr`:

<pre><code>type ty_expr =
  | TyCon        of id
  | <em>TyConApp     of ty_expr * ty_expr list</em>
  | FunctionType of ty_expr list * ty_expr
  | ForAll       of id list * ty_expr
  | TyVar        of id
</code></pre>

* `TyConApp` represents _application_ of type constructors
  to one or more types

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* In code, the types are formed using the OCaml type `ty_expr`:

<pre><code>type ty_expr =
  | TyCon        of id
  | TyConApp     of ty_expr * ty_expr list
  | <em>FunctionType of ty_expr list * ty_expr</em>
  | ForAll       of id list * ty_expr
  | TyVar        of id
</code></pre>

* `FunctionType` represents types of functions

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* In code, the types are formed using the OCaml type `ty_expr`:

<pre><code>type ty_expr =
  | TyCon        of id
  | TyConApp     of ty_expr * ty_expr list
  | FunctionType of ty_expr list * ty_expr
  | <em>ForAll       of id list * ty_expr</em>
  | TyVar        of id
</code></pre>

* `ForAll` represents types with `forall` _i.e._ &hairsp;
  polymorphic types with type variables

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* In code, the types are formed using the OCaml type `ty_expr`:

<pre><code>type ty_expr =
  | TyCon        of id
  | TyConApp     of ty_expr * ty_expr list
  | FunctionType of ty_expr list * ty_expr
  | ForAll       of id list * ty_expr
  | <em>TyVar        of id</em>
</code></pre>

* `TyVar` represents type variables

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* Here is the rule for type constructors:

$$
\frac{\mu \in \text{dom}\ \Delta}
{\Delta \vdash \text{TYCON}(\mu) :: \Delta(\mu)}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{KindIntroCon}
$$

* This says that for a type expression
  of the form `$\text{TYCON}(\mu)$`,
  where `$\mu$` is a type constructor,
  look up `$\mu$` in the kind environment `$\Delta$`
  to get its kind

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* Here is the rule for type constructors:

$$
\frac{\mu \in \text{dom}\ \Delta}
{\Delta \vdash \text{TYCON}(\mu) :: \Delta(\mu)}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{KindIntroCon}
$$

* Note that `$\text{TYCON}(\mu)$` is abstract syntax
  * We'll be seeing more abstract syntax
    for type expressions in the next few slides

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* Here is the rule for applying type constructors to type arguments:

$$
\frac
{\Delta \vdash \tau :: \kappa_1 \times \cdots \times \kappa_n
\Rightarrow \kappa \hskip{1em}
\Delta \vdash \tau_i :: \kappa_i, \hskip{1em}
1 \leq i \leq n}
{\Delta \vdash \text{CONAPP}(\tau, [\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n]) :: \kappa}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{KindApp}
$$

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* This says that for a type expression
  `$\text{CONAPP}(\tau, [\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n])$`...
---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* This says that for a type expression
  `$\text{CONAPP}(\tau, [\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n])$`...
  * ...where the type constructor `$\tau$`
  is applied to type arguments `$\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n$`
  * ...the type expression is valid<br/>(and has kind `$\kappa$`)...
---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* This says that for a type expression
  `$\text{CONAPP}(\tau, [\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n])$`...
  * ...if the type constructor `$\tau$`
       is in the kind environment `$\Delta$`
  * ...has a function kind
  * ...there are the right number of argument types $\tau_i$
  * ...and each of them has the right kind `$\kappa_i$`

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* Note that these rules are more general than we need!

* In our language, type constructor applications will always have
  kind `*`
  * _e.g._ `(list int)`, `(pair int bool)`,<br/>`(list (list int))`
    _etc._

* In some more complex languages (like Haskell),
  there can be type constructor applications that yield type constructors

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* Here is the rule for forming function types:

$$
\frac
{
\Delta \vdash
\tau_i :: *, \\ 1 \leq i \leq n
\hskip{1em}
\Delta \vdash
\tau :: *
}
{
\Delta \vdash
\tau_1 \times \cdots \times \tau_n \Rightarrow
\tau :: *
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{KindFunction}
$$

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* This says that if all the `$\tau_i$` have kinds `*` in `$\Delta$`
  and there are the right number of them,
  and the result type `$\tau$` also has kind `*` in `$\Delta$`,
  then we can form the function type

$$
\tau_1 \times \cdots \times \tau_n \Rightarrow \tau :: *
$$

* which will have kind `*`


---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* We still have to have formal type formation rules for:
  * type variables
  * universally-quantified types

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* Type variables are simple: just look them up in the kind environment:

$$
\frac
{
\alpha \in dom\ \Delta
}
{
\Delta \vdash \text{TYVAR}(\alpha) :: \Delta(\alpha)
}
$$

* (Just like type constructors!)

* We will assume that type variables always have kind `*` in our language

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* The rule for forming universally-quantified types is:

$$
\frac
{
\Delta\\{\alpha_1 :: *, \ldots, \alpha_n :: *\\} \vdash \tau :: *
}
{
\Delta \vdash
\text{FORALL}(\langle
\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n
\rangle, \tau) :: *
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{KindForAll}
$$

---
## Type formation rules (formal)

* This says that if you:
  * add to the kind environment `$\Delta$` the type variables `$\alpha_i$`,
    each with kind `*`,
  * and can then deduce that type `$\tau$` has kind `*`,
  * then the type
    $\text{FORALL}(\langle \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \rangle, \tau)$
    is a valid type with kind `*`

* (Presumably, `$\tau$` will contain some/all
  of the type variables `$\alpha_i$`)

---
## Whew!

* That's it for type formation rules!
