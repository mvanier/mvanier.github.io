# CS 131:<br/>Programming Languages
## _Lecture 9_:<br/>The _$\mu$Scheme+_ Language: Operational semantics

---
## Today

* The _$\mu$Scheme+_ language: operational semantics

---
## Overview

* The _$\mu$Scheme+_ language is _$\mu$Scheme_ extended with "control operators"
  * `break` and `continue`
  * `throw` and `try-catch`
  * `return`

---
## Overview

* Last time, we saw that adding control operators requires us to change our
  evaluator to use a stack of "contexts"

* Each "context" represents a partially-evaluated expression

---
## Overview

* This also requires us to change the operational semantics from a "big-step"
  semantics to a more granular "small-step" semantics

* In this lecture, we will present and discuss the small-step semantics for the
  _$\mu$Scheme+_ language

---
## Structure of the semantics

* In the big-step semantics, each semantics "judgment" has the form<br/>
  $\langle e, \rho, \sigma \rangle \Downarrow \langle v, \sigma' \rangle$

* A judgment is the conclusion of a "rule" (below the line)

* This says: the expression $e$ evaluates (after one or more steps) to a value
  $v$, possibly modifying the store $\sigma$ to $\sigma'$, but not modifying the
  environment $\rho$

---
## Structure of the semantics

* In small-step semantics, semantic judgments look quite different:
  $\langle e/v, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle \rightarrow
   \langle e'/v', \rho', \sigma', S' \rangle$

* Notice that the "reduction arrow" ($\Downarrow$) has been replaced with the
  "step arrow" ($\rightarrow$)

* Meaning: you aren't reducing a form to its ultimate result; you're just
  performing _one_ step of the evaluation

---
## Structure of the semantics

$$
\langle e/v, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e'/v', \rho', \sigma', S' \rangle
$$

* Notice also that instead of $e$ on the left and $v$ on the right, we have
  $e/v$ and $e'/v'$

* Sometimes, steps involve expressions, and sometimes they involve values

---
## Structure of the semantics

$$
\langle e/v, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e'/v', \rho', \sigma', S' \rangle
$$

* Notice that the store ($\sigma$) and the environment<br/>($\rho$)
  can _both_ change as the result of a step

---
## Structure of the semantics

$$
\langle e/v, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e'/v', \rho', \sigma', S' \rangle
$$

* In big-step semantics, only the store could change
  when evaluating an expression

* However, a partially-evaluated `let` expression (among others)
  could certainly alter the environment
  * (even though it would eventually go back to what it was before)

---
## Structure of the semantics

$$
\langle e/v, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e'/v', \rho', \sigma', S' \rangle
$$

* Finally, notice the extra $S$ argument

* This is the context stack, which can change as the result of evaluating a
step

---
## Semantics: typical cases

* Before we show you the actual rules of the semantics,
  it's worth focusing in on typical classes of cases
  that show up in multiple rules

---
## Semantics: typical cases

$$
\langle e, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e', \rho, \sigma, F :: S \rangle
$$

* In this case, $e'$ is a subexpression of $e$

* The rest of $e$ is contained in the context $F$ which is pushed onto the
stack $S$
  * The $::$ operator represents "pushing onto the stack"

---
## Semantics: typical cases

$$
\langle e, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e', \rho, \sigma, F :: S \rangle
$$

* Conceptually, $F$ is just $e$ where the $e'$ subexpression has been replaced
  with a "hole" where its value will eventually go

* $F$ stands for "frame" _i.e._ a particular kind of context

---
## Semantics: typical cases

$$
\langle v, \rho, \sigma, F :: S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
$$

* Here, $e$ is the result of plugging $v$ into a "hole" in frame $F$, which gets
popped off the stack

---
## Semantics: typical cases

$$
\langle e, \rho, \sigma, F :: S \rangle
\rightarrow
\langle e, \rho, \sigma, S \rangle
$$

* Here, $e$ is a control operator (like `break`) which simply pops the context
stack and continues looking for the place where it will terminate

---
## Semantics: typical cases

$$
\langle e, \rho, \sigma, [] \rangle
\rightarrow^{*}
\langle v, \rho, \sigma', [] \rangle
$$

* Here, $e$ is a top-level expression or part of a definition

* It evaluates to a value $v$, possibly changing the store
  * The $\rightarrow^{*}$ means "one or more steps"

---
## Semantics: typical cases

$$
\langle e, \rho, \sigma, [] \rangle
\rightarrow^{*}
\langle v, \rho, \sigma', [] \rangle
$$

* $[]$ represents an empty stack

* Once the stack is empty,
  and the right-hand side of $\rightarrow^{*}$ is a value,
  we have finished evaluating the form $e$

---
## Semantics walkthrough

* OK, now we will begin going through the actual operational semantics rules

* There are a lot of them (more than in any other language in this course), so
strap yourself in!

---
## Small-step semantics: literals

<img src="images/literal.png" alt="literal.png" />

* The upper rule is the big-step rule; the lower rule is the small-step rule
---
## Small-step semantics: literals

<img src="images/literal.png" alt="literal.png" />

* Other than the presence of the stack $S$ (which doesn't change), there is no
difference: literals evaluate to themselves

---
## Small-step semantics: variables

<img src="images/var.png" alt="var.png" />

* Variables are also basically the same; just look them up in the environment

---
## Small-step semantics: `lambda`

<img src="images/lambda.png" alt="lambda.png" />

* `lambda` forms are also the same: just make a closure

---
## Small-step semantics: `set`

* The simplest example of using the stack is the rule for assignment (`set`)

* An assignment is composed of two parts:
  * Evaluate an expression to get a value
  * Assign the value to a name

---
## Small-step semantics: `set`

* The big-step rule does this all in one rule:

<img src="images/big_step_set.png" alt="big_step_set.png" />

---
## Small-step semantics: `set`

* The small-step rule divides this into two rules

* First, do the evaluation of the expression $e$:

<img src="images/small_step_set_1.png" alt="small_step_set_1.png" />

* This rule pushes the `set` expression (with a hole where the value goes) onto
the stack

* Then the expression $e$ is evaluated according to one of the other rules

---
## Small-step semantics: `set`

* Once the expression $e$ has been evaluated to the value $v$, we can pop the
stack and finish the assignment:

<img src="images/small_step_set_2.png" alt="small_step_set_2.png" />

* Notice how the store $\sigma$ gets updated in this rule

---
## Small-step semantics: `if`

<img src="images/if_1.png" alt="if_1.png" />

* In an `if` form, we start by evaluating the test expression $e_1$

---
## Small-step semantics: `if`

<img src="images/if_1.png" alt="if_1.png" />

* The rest of the expression (the `if` with a hole where the result of
evaluating $e_1$ goes) gets pushed onto the stack

* Then $e_1$ gets evaluated according to the other rules

---
## Small-step semantics: `if`

<img src="images/if_2.png" alt="if_2.png" />

* These two rules show how we resolve the `if` once the test expression $e_1$
has been evaluated to the value $v$

---
## Small-step semantics: `if`

<img src="images/if_2.png" alt="if_2.png" />

* Notice how the _IF_ frame gets popped off the stack in both cases

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

* Function application requires six (6) rules to specify completely

* (Actually, the last rule is a family of rules, one for each primitive
function)

* Take a deep breath...

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_1.png" alt="function_1.png" />

* To apply a function, first evaluate the expression in "function position",
which is $e$

* The rest of the expression is pushed onto the stack, with a hole where the
function will go

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_2.png" alt="function_2.png" />

* Once the function position expression has been evaluated to a value $v$,
evaluate the expression in the first argument position $e_1$

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_2.png" alt="function_2.png" />

* Push the rest of the expression (evaluated and unevaluated parts)
  back onto the stack:
  * The function value $v$ (evaluated)
  * The other arguments $e_2$, $e_3$, ... $e_n$<br/>(not evaluated)

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_3.png" alt="function_3.png" />

* When you are in the middle of evaluating the function's argument expressions,
some of them have been evaluated to values and some haven't

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_3.png" alt="function_3.png" />

* Take the first unevaluated expression $e_{i+1}$ and evaluate that, putting the
previously-evaluated argument value $v_i$ back onto the stack along with the
rest of the expression (evaluated and unevaluated parts)

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_3.png" alt="function_3.png" />

* (This represents a left-to-right evaluation order)

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_4.png" alt="function_4.png" />

* Once you've evaluated the last argument (to the value $v_n$), things get more
complicated

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_4.png" alt="function_4.png" />

* We evaluate the function body expression ($e_c$)
  in a new environment which extends the original environment $\rho_c$
  by binding the formal argument names $x_i$ to their values $v_i$
  (via $\sigma_n$ and $\ell_i$)

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_4.png" alt="function_4.png" />

* The store is used as an intermediary between the names and the values,
  as usual

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_4.png" alt="function_4.png" />

* Also, we have to be able to restore the old environment $\rho$
  when we finish evaluating the body of the function

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_4.png" alt="function_4.png" />

* We do this by pushing a _CALLENV_ frame onto the stack
  which contains the old environment $\rho$

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_5.png" alt="function_5.png" />

* Once the body of the function has been evaluated to a value $v$,
  we don't need the new environment anymore, so we restore the old one
  by popping off the _CALLENV_ frame

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_6.png" alt="function_6.png" />

* The previous discussion assumed that the function being applied
  was a user-defined function (a closure)

---
## Small-step semantics: Function application

<img src="images/function_6.png" alt="function_6.png" />

* However, it could also be a primitive (like `+`)

* In this case, once the last argument is evaluated, just apply the function to
the evaluated arguments to get the result value

---
## Small-step semantics: `let`

* Evaluating `let` expressions was quite complicated in the big-step semantics

* The small-step semantics is complicated too, but the complexity is divided up
between multiple rules (like it is for function application)

---
## Small-step semantics: `let`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Let-Start.png" alt="Small-Step-Let-Start.png" />

* To start with, evaluate the first expression $e_1$ in the first binding

---
## Small-step semantics: `let`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Let-Next-Exp.png" alt="Small-Step-Let-Next-Exp.png" />

* Continue evaluating the binding expressions, adjusting the stack frame
accordingly

---
## Small-step semantics: `let`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Let-Body.png" alt="Small-Step-Let-Body.png" />

* After evaluating the last binding expression:
  * Create a new environment with all the $x_i \mapsto v_i$ bindings
  * Evaluate the body $e$ in that environment
  * Push a _LETENV_ frame containing the old environment onto the stack

---
## Small-step semantics: `let`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Let-Restore-Env.png" alt="Small-Step-Let-Restore-Env.png" />

* Once the let body is evaluated to a value $v$, restore the original
environment

---
## Small-step semantics: `let*`

<img src="images/Small-Step-LetStar.png" alt="Small-Step-LetStar.png" width="900" />

* The circled values are not holes;
  they just indicate which subexpression is being evaluated

---
## Small-step semantics: `let*`

<img src="images/Small-Step-LetStar.png" alt="Small-Step-LetStar.png" width="900" />

* The rule which restores the original environment (pops _LETENV_ off stack)
  is the same as the corresponding rule for `let`

---
## Small-step semantics: `let*`

<img src="images/Small-Step-LetStar.png" alt="Small-Step-LetStar.png" width="900" />

* `let*` doesn't need to store any values on the stack when
  evaluating bindings, since they are always put into the environment
  immediately

---
## Small-step semantics: `let*`

<img src="images/Small-Step-LetStar.png" alt="Small-Step-LetStar.png" width="900" />

* (This is why we don't use holes to represent
  the expression being evaluated)

---
## Small-step semantics: `letrec`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Letrec.png" alt="Small-Step-Letrec.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Next-Letrec-Exp.png" alt="Small-Step-Next-Letrec-Exp.png" width="900" />

* This is basically `let` with "unspecified" bound to all $x_i$ before the start

---
## Small-step semantics: `begin`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Begin-1.png" alt="Small-Step-Begin-1.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Begin-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Begin-2.png" width="900" />

* We put `#u` instead of `#f` in second rule
  (only relevant for empty `begin`)

---
## Small-step semantics: `while`

<img src="images/Small-Step-While-1.png" alt="Small-Step-While-1.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-While-2.png" alt="Small-Step-While-2.png" width="900" />

* Note that _WHILE_ and _WHILE_RUNNING_BODY_ frames contain both $e_1$ and $e_2$

---
## Small-step semantics: `while`

<img src="images/Small-Step-While-1.png" alt="Small-Step-While-1.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-While-2.png" alt="Small-Step-While-2.png" width="900" />

* (May need to evaluate entire expression again!)

---
## Small-step semantics: `while`

<img src="images/Small-Step-While-1.png" alt="Small-Step-While-1.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-While-2.png" alt="Small-Step-While-2.png" width="900" />

* Again, we make `while` return `#u`, not `#f`

---
## Small-step semantics: `break`

* `break` is pretty simple in the small-step semantics:

<img src="images/Small-Step-Break-Unwind.png" alt="Small-Step-Break-Unwind.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Break-Transfer.png" alt="Small-Step-Break-Transfer.png" width="900" />

* Again, `break`ing out of a `while` loop returns `#u`, not `#f`

---
## Small-step semantics: `break`

* `break` is pretty simple in the small-step semantics:

<img src="images/Small-Step-Break-Unwind.png" alt="Small-Step-Break-Unwind.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Break-Transfer.png" alt="Small-Step-Break-Transfer.png" width="900" />

* Note that we can't unwind the stack past a function call boundary
  (_CALLENV_ on the stack)

---
## Small-step semantics: `break`

* `break` is pretty simple in the small-step semantics:

<img src="images/Small-Step-Break-Unwind.png" alt="Small-Step-Break-Unwind.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Break-Transfer.png" alt="Small-Step-Break-Transfer.png" width="900" />

* Note omission: _LETENV_ frame must change environment
  when popped from `break`

---
## Small-step semantics: `continue`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Continue-Unwind.png" alt="Small-Step-Continue-Unwind.png" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Continue-Transfer.png" alt="Small-Step-Continue-Transfer.png" />

* The transfer rule is the only difference
  between `break`'s and `continue`'s semantics
  * `break` exits the `while`; `continue` restarts it

---
## Small-step semantics: `continue`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Continue-Unwind.png" alt="Small-Step-Continue-Unwind.png" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Continue-Transfer.png" alt="Small-Step-Continue-Transfer.png" />

* Note omission: _LETENV_ frame must change environment
  when popped from `break`

---
## Small-step semantics: `return`

<img src="images/Small-Step-Return.png" alt="Small-Step-Return.png" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Return-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Return-2.png" />

* This is pretty obvious when you think about it
* No need to worry about _LETENV_ on stack (why?)

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Throw-1.png" alt="Small-Step-Throw-1.png" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Throw-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Throw-2.png" />

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Try-Catch-1.png" alt="Small-Step-Try-Catch-1.png" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" />

<img src="images/Small-Step-Try-Catch-3.png" alt="Small-Step-Try-Catch-3.png" />

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

* There is a _lot_ of subtle stuff going on with the `throw` and
`try`/`catch` rules!

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

* Let's start with the simple stuff:

<img src="images/Small-Step-Throw-1.png" alt="Small-Step-Throw-1.png" />

* In order to evaluate a `throw` expression, first evaluate its
subexpression
* The `throw` (with a hole for the value to throw) goes on the context stack

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Try-Catch-1.png" alt="Small-Step-Try-Catch-1.png" />

* Before installing an exception handler ($e_h$), you have to evaluate it to get
a function

* The body of the `try`/`catch` ($e_b$) goes on the context stack

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" />

* If the exception handler evaluates to a function, install it as an exception
handler on the context stack

* Then start evaluating the body of the `try`/`catch`

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" />

* The _LETENV_ form goes on the stack in case there are more forms to evaluate
  after the `try`/`catch` (like in a `begin` form)
  * In that case, need to make sure that we restore the correct environment (subtle!)

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Try-Catch-2.png" />

* If the exception handler _doesn't_ evaluate to a function, it's an error, and
  the operational semantics has nothing further to say about it
  * evaluation "gets stuck" as usual on errors

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Throw-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Throw-2.png" />

* In the case of a `throw`, unwind the context stack until we hit a
  `try`/`catch` frame

* We don't care about function call boundaries

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Throw-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Throw-2.png" />

* In the case of a `throw`, unwind the context stack until we hit a
  `try`/`catch` frame

* We don't adjust the environment when popping a _LETENV_ or _CALLENV_ frame
either (why?)

---
## Small-step semantics: exception handling

<img src="images/Small-Step-Throw-2.png" alt="Small-Step-Throw-2.png" />

* In the case of a `throw`, unwind the context stack until we hit a
  `try`/`catch` frame

* Once we get to a `try`/`catch` frame, apply the exception handler to the value
thrown


---
## Small-step semantics: definitions

* Definitions are not really any different from the big-step versions except for
  an empty stack component

---
## Small-step semantics: definitions

<img src="images/Small-Step-Define-Global.png" alt="Small-Step-Define-Global.png" />

* Note in top rule: $\rho$ can't actually change while evaluating expression

---
## Small-step semantics: definitions

<img src="images/Small-Step-Define-Global.png" alt="Small-Step-Define-Global.png" />

* Note in second rule: we don't return value $v$ set when evaluating $SET$
  (just `#u`)

---
## Summing up

* There are so many rules because

  * The control operators have complicated semantics

  * Small-step semantics are fine-grained,
    and need a lot of detail to explain them

* Kind of grungy, but you need this much detail to write the evaluator!

---
