Course description
------------------

From the Caltech catalog:

.. pull-quote::

   CS 131 is a course on programming languages and their implementation.
   It teaches students how to program in a number of simplified languages
   representing the major programming paradigms in use today
   (imperative, object-oriented, and functional).
   It will also teach students how to build and modify
   the implementations of these languages.
   Emphasis will not be on syntax or parsing
   but on the essential differences
   in these languages and their implementations.
   Both dynamically-typed and statically-typed languages will be implemented.
   Relevant theory will be covered as needed.
   Implementations will mostly be interpreters,
   but some features of compilers will be covered if time permits. 


Textbook
--------

This course is based around the textbook
`Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare`_, by Norman Ramsey.
We will often abbreviate this book as *PL:PBC*.


External websites
-----------------

There will be a Piazza site, which you will be enrolled in
if you are registered for this course.

For homework submission and grading, we will use CodePost_.


Office hours
------------

Office hours will either be held in-person or on Zoom,
at the discretion of the teaching assistant.
Mike will hold his office hours on Zoom.
Office hour times will be posted on Piazza.


Grading scheme
--------------

CS 131 is on grades. There are no exams.

There will be 5 or 6 assignments, worth 10 marks each. Each assignment is
divided into sections. Each section is given an integer grade from 0 to 10. The
overall grade of the assignment is the *average* grade of all sections. In
addition, there will be an end-of-course survey which will be worth 4 marks if
you fill it out.

.. note::

   The CodePost grading system doesn't handle averages, so on CodePost,
   the grade will be the *sum* of the section grades.
   This will be divided by the number of sections to give the actual grade.

Grades are determined by taking the maximum grade (64 if there are 6
assignments, 54 if there are 5 assignments)
and scaling it to a maximum of 100.
Then letter grades are assigned to these percentages as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Numerical grade (out of 100%)
     - Letter grade
   * - 95-100%
     - A+
   * - 90-95%
     - A

     - D+

     - D
   * - < 55%
     - F


Redoing assignments
-------------------

After you receive your initial grade on an assignment,
you have *one week* to submit a redo.
Redos will be submitted as a separate CodePost assignment called
``Assignment N (rework)`` (for assignment ``N``).
Late redos (received after the 1-week redo window)
will not be graded and your previous grade will stand.
You may not submit more than one redo per assignment.


Late policy for assignments
---------------------------

If an assignment is late when first submitted, marks are deducted at the rate
of 2.0 marks/day.  These marks can't be regained through rework.  If a rework
is late (|ie| is submitted more than one week after the original grade was
submitted), it doesn't count, and the previous grade stands.

.. note::

   If an assignment is submitted on time, but is missing one or more sections,
   those sections will be graded as a 0.
   The assignment can be reworked, of course,
   but assuming the sections that were missing on the initial submission
   are submitted with the rework,
   there is no additional rework for these sections.
   This means (for instance) if you don't submit a section
   on the initial submission but do submit it in the rework,
   the grade of that section in the rework is final --
   you don't get to rework it just because you hadn't submitted it before.
   So please don't leave out sections!
 
Students may request extensions for assignments due to unusual circumstances.
These extensions have to be approved by the course instructor (Mike).


Assignment due dates
--------------------

Assignments will be due on |dueday| at |duetime| unless otherwise indicated.
Note that a due time of |duetime| means early that morning, so effectively it
means very late the previous evening.


Attendance and participation
----------------------------

Attendance and participation currently do not count towards the final grade.
However, we strive to make lectures interactive and do a lot of demos and
discussion during lectures.  Missing out on this will deprive you of many of
the benefits of the course (as well as a lot of the fun!).
All lectures slides will be posted.


Academic integrity
------------------

Caltechâ€™s Honor Code states that: "No member of the Caltech community shall
take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community."

*Understanding and avoiding plagiarism*: Plagiarism is the appropriation of
another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate
credit, and it violates the honor code in a fundamental way. You can find more
information at `this page <http://writing.caltech.edu/resources/plagiarism>`_.


Collaboration policies
----------------------

The course collaboration policies are listed in the
:doc:`/content/admin/Collaboration_policies` page in this book.

.. note::

   **Please read the collaboration policies!**
   You are responsible for knowing what is an isn't acceptable collaboration,
   and if you over-collaborate you may be sent to the Board of Control,
   which is never pleasant.


Software
--------

See the :doc:`Software </content/Software>` page
for information on installing the course software.


Diversity and inclusion
-----------------------

You all belong in this class and as such should expect to be treated by your
classmates and the course staff with respect. It is our goal, as the course
staff, to provide an interesting and challenging environment that is conducive
to learning. If any incident occurs that challenges this commitment to a
supportive and inclusive environment, please let the instructors know so the
issue can be addressed.

Accessibility
-------------

We consider accessibility to be an extremely important issue.  If some aspect
of the course is making it more difficult for you to learn the material, we
want to hear about it!  We want this course to be an enjoyable experience for
you, not a burden.

Student Wellness
----------------

It is very important to us that you take care of your mental wellness
throughout the course. Everyone on the course staff is available to chat, and
you can always attend office hours for a non-academic conversation if
necessary.

Students with documented disabilities
-------------------------------------

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a
disability must initiate the request with Caltech Accessibility Services for
Students (CASS).  Professional staff will evaluate the request with required
documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an
Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the
request is being made. Students should contact CASS as soon as possible, since
timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations.
See the `CASS website <http://cass.caltech.edu/>`_ for more information.

Undergraduate students should contact Dr. Lesley Nye, associate Dean of
Undergraduate Students (administrative contact: Beth Larranaga) and graduate
students should contact Dr. Kate McAnulty, Associate Dean of Graduate Studies
(administrative contact: Jacob Dalton).
