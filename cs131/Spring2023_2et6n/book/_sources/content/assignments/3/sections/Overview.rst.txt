Overview
========

The theme of this assignment is "control operators". In part A, you will
be implementing the control operators that we have described in class,
specifically:

* ``break``
* ``continue``
* ``return``
* ``throw``
* ``try-catch``

In part B, you will implement tail call optimization, which is a
fundamental technique in functional programming languages (it’s what
allows us to use recursion for loops).

What we *won’t* do in this assignment is make you write code in
|uschemeplus|. The reason for this is that control operators don’t lend
themselves to writing new and exciting kinds of code, unlike (say) the
addition of first-class functions in μScheme. Mostly, control operators
are useful for specific tasks, and you know when you need one. Instead,
we are providing you with test scripts that exercise all the features we
want you to implement.
