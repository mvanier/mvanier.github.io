Overview
========

The theme of this assignment is "type checking". In part A, you will be
implementing the array operations we have discussed in class (both the
type checking code and the evaluation code). Specifically, you’ll be
implementing:

* ``make-array``
* ``array-at``
* ``array-put``
* ``array-size``

In part B, you will add typed local variables to the language.

In part C, you’ll write some functions using the new features.
