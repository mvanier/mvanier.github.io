# CS 131:<br/>Programming Languages
## _Lecture 1_:<br/>Introduction

---
## Today

* Overall structure of the course
* Subject matter: What is covered / not covered
* Prerequisites
* Textbook
* Theory
* Languages we will implement
* Overview of programming language implementation

---
## Logistics

* Lectures: MWF, 3 PM
* Weekly or biweekly assignments
  * due Friday, 2 AM
* No exams!

---
## Subject matter

* This is a course on _implementing programming languages_

* It is _not_ a course on "compilers"

* We will implement several different programming languages

* These implementations will be _interpreters_ and will not be optimized for speed

---
## Subject matter

* Goal: to understand how programming languages work internally

* Not a goal: to write industrial-strength language implementations with
state-of-the-art performance

---
## However...

* We'll find that the terms "interpreter" and "compiler" are very blurry
  * You can't implement an interpreter without doing _some_ "compilation"
* More so for some languages than others

---
## _Warning!_

* Implementing programming languages can be
  <span style="color:red">*VERY VERY ADDICTIVE*!</span>

* It seems to bring out the "control freak" aspect of some programmers,
and you may find it hard to tear yourself away from the code

* (Especially true for languages you design yourself!)

---
## Note!

* You will not get to implement your _own_ programming languages
in this course!

* However, if this is something you want to do,
this course will be essential knowledge for you

* Afterwords, just take a CS 81 with me and write your dream language!

---
## Subject matter

* We are mainly interested in:
  * What are the _fundamental_ differences between programming languages?
  * How do these differences affect the implementation?

* We will see that small additions to a language can require large changes in
  the implementation strategies

---
## Syntax and parsing

* We will _not_ be covering parsing theory

* Two reasons:
  * It's relatively uninteresting (in my opinion)
  * Implementing parsers is relatively easy using parser generating tools

* If you think that "all programming languages are the same except for syntax"
  we hope that this course will make you change your mind!

---
## Syntax and parsing

* Instead, all of our languages will use the simplest possible syntax,
  which is <br/>
  <span style="color:red">*"S-expression"*</span>
  syntax

* If you've ever programmed in a Lisp dialect (_e.g._ Scheme, Clojure, Racket),
  you have seen this syntax already

---
## Syntax and parsing

* Scheme example:

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

---
## Syntax and parsing

* An <span style="color:red">*"S-expression"*</span> is either:

    * an <span style="color:red">"atom"</span> (an identifier or an integer)
    * or a <span style="color:red">list</span> of S-expressions (in parentheses)

* Comments start with one or more semicolons (<span style="color:red">;</span>)
  and go to the end of the line

* That's it!

---
## Syntax and parsing

![Lisp](./images/lisp_cycles.png)

---
## Syntax and parsing

* Reasons for this choice:
  * We don't have to waste time figuring out the optimal syntax
    for each new language
  * We don't have to add syntax for every new feature we add to a language
  * We don't have to remember new syntax either!
  * The parser implementation is trivial and easy to understand

---
## Syntax and parsing

* Downside:
  * Most people don't enjoy using this syntax as much as a syntax
    specifically tailored to a given language

---
## Typical assignment

* A typical assignment will involve a particular programming language we are
  implementing

* You will be given a starting code base which contains a partial implementation
  of the language

---
## Typical assignment

* Then, you will:
  * complete the implementation (if necessary)
  * write functions in the language
  * implement new features in the language
  * write functions using the new features

---
## Prerequisites

* All of our implementations will be in the OCaml language

* Therefore, knowledge of this language is an **absolute hard prerequisite**

* CS 4 with OCaml is sufficient background to take this course

---
## Why OCaml?

* OCaml is a near-ideal language for implementing interpreters (and compilers!)

* Useful features include:
  * algebraic data types (especially!)
  * functional programming support
  * high level of abstraction
  * module system
  * garbage collection
  * speed!

---
## Textbook

* This course is based on a textbook:<br/>
_Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare_ by Norman Ramsey

* We will not be covering the entire book<br/>(775 pages!)

---
## Textbook

![Textbook](./images/Ramsey_small.jpg)

---
## Textbook

* Ramsey's book uses _C_ and _Standard ML_ as the implementation languages;
  we will only use OCaml

![You're welcome!](./images/youre_welcome.gif)

---
## Textbook

* We won't be implementing all of Ramsey's languages either

* However, most of the course material and most of the exercises come from this
  book
---
## Textbook

* We can't distribute the PDF of the book for copyright reasons

  * However, we will provide material from some parts of the book that
    will be needed in doing the homework
  * _e.g._ operational semantics equations
---
## Operational semantics

* _Operational semantics_ is a mathematical way of specifying how a particular
  programming language is evaluated

* One sub-goal of this course is to get you comfortable with reading operational
  semantics equations

* They seem intimidating at first, but all they are is a compressed description
  of the evaluation rules of a language
---
## Operational semantics

* Example equation:

$$
\frac{x \in dom\ \rho}{\langle \operatorname{VAR}(x),
\xi, \phi, \rho \rangle \Downarrow
\langle \rho(x), \xi, \phi, \rho \rangle}
\newline
\label{}\tag{FormalVar}
$$

* This is called an <span style="color:red">_inference rule_</span>
* Its _label_ is $\text{FormalVar}$, which allows us to refer to it later
---
## Operational semantics

$$
\frac{x \in dom\ \rho}{\langle \operatorname{VAR}(x),
\xi, \phi, \rho \rangle \Downarrow
\langle \rho(x), \xi, \phi, \rho \rangle}
\newline
\label{}\tag{FormalVar}
$$

* The part(s) above the line are the
  <span style="color:red">_premises_</span>
* The part(s) below the line are the
  <span style="color:red">_conclusions_</span>
* _If_ the part(s) above the line are true,
  _then_ so are the parts below the line
---
## Operational semantics

$$
\frac{x \in dom\ \rho}{\langle \operatorname{VAR}(x),
\xi, \phi, \rho \rangle \Downarrow
\langle \rho(x), \xi, \phi, \rho \rangle}
\newline
\label{}\tag{FormalVar}
$$

* What this rule says:
  * _Given_ that $x$ is in the variable environment $\rho$,
  * to evaluate a variable reference $\operatorname{VAR}(x)$,
  * look it up in $\rho$ (giving $\rho(x)$, its value in $\rho$),
  * without changing any of the environments.
---
## Operational semantics

$$
\frac{x \in dom\ \rho}{\langle \operatorname{VAR}(x),
\xi, \phi, \rho \rangle \Downarrow
\langle \rho(x), \xi, \phi, \rho \rangle}
\newline
\label{}\tag{FormalVar}
$$


* $\operatorname{VAR}(x)$ is a constructor of the algebraic datatype
  representing the _abstract syntax_ of the language that is being described
* We will have much more to say about abstract syntax shortly
---
## Operational semantics

$$
\frac{x \in dom\ \rho}{\langle \operatorname{VAR}(x),
\xi, \phi, \rho \rangle \Downarrow
\langle \rho(x), \xi, \phi, \rho \rangle}
\newline
\label{}\tag{FormalVar}
$$

* Inference rules like this can describe the exact workings of
  language evaluators and type systems
  * More concise and specific than spoken-language descriptions
  * Also independent of the implementation language
---
## Operational semantics

* We will not normally ask you to write your own inference rules

* We _will_ expect you to be able to read and understand inference rules we give you

---
## Operational semantics

* There are two broad classes of operational semantics inference rules:
  * _small-step_ semantics
  * _large-step_ semantics

* We will see examples of both classes as we proceed
---
## Languages we'll implement

* We will implement several different programming languages

* Some will be imperative, some mostly-functional

* There will be
  * untyped,
  * dynamically-typed,
  * and statically-typed languages.
---
## Languages we'll implement

* First language: _Imp_

* This is an "untyped" imperative language
* "Untyped" here means that the only type of values will be integers
  * (So no type checking!)

* The goal is to get comfortable with the basics of language implementation
  in as simple a setting as possible
---
## Languages we'll implement

* Sample Imp code:

```
(val result 1)
(define factorial (n)
  (begin
    (set result 1)
    (while (> n 0)
      (begin
        (set result (* result n))
        (set n (- n 1))))
    result))
```
---
## Languages we'll implement

* Second language: _Micro-Scheme_ or _$\mu$Scheme_

* A "dynamically-typed" language
  * multiple types, checked at run-time
  * types: integers, booleans, symbols, lists, functions

* First-class functions (`lambda` forms)
---
## Languages we'll implement

* Example of $\mu$Scheme code:

```
(let-rec
  ((factorial
     (lambda (n)
        (if (= n 0)
            1
            (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))))
  (factorial 10))
```
---
## Languages we'll implement

* Third language: _$\mu$Scheme+_

* This extends $\mu$Scheme with control operators:
  * `break`
  * `continue`
  * `return`
  * `throw`
  * `try-catch`

* This will turn out to require major changes to the interpreter!
---
## Languages we'll implement

* Example of $\mu$Scheme+ code:

```
(define (factorial x)
  (let ((result 1))
    (begin
      (while #t
        (begin
          (if (<= x 0) (break) nil)
          (set result (* result x))
          (set x (- x 1))))
      result)))
```
---
## Languages we'll implement

* After this, we will implement _statically typed_ languages

* This means that types will be checked before running the program, and a type
error will mean the code can't run (like in OCaml)

* We will implement (at least) two statically-typed languages this year
---
## Side note

* Implementing dynamically-typed languages is fairly easy
  * (Lots of amateur language designers have done it)

* Some of these languages have become quite well-known
  * Perl, Python, Ruby, Javascript
---
## Side note

* Implementing statically-typed languages is _much_ harder

* Implementing statically-typed languages with _polymorphic type systems_
and _type inference_ is even harder
  * Very few language designers ever implement this kind of language

* And yet, you will do it in this course!
---
## Languages we'll implement

* The first statically-typed language we will implement is _Imp_ with static
types (_Typed Imp_)

* Recall that _Imp_ is "untyped" (all types are integers)

* We will extend _Imp_ with booleans, array types, and the "unit" type

* Like _Imp_, the implementation is fairly simple
---
## Languages we'll implement

* Example of _Typed Imp_ code:

```
(val result 1)
; note type annotation on x:
(define int factorial ((x : int))
  (begin
    (set result 1)
    (while (> x 0)
      (begin
        (set result (* result x))
        (set x (- x 1))))
    result))
```
---
## Languages we'll implement

* The second statically-typed language we will implement is _$\mu$Scheme_
with static types (_Typed $\mu$Scheme_)

* This implementation is _much_ more involved
  * polymorphic types
  * kinds

* _Typed $\mu$Scheme_ is also rather painful to program in
  (lots of type annotations!)

---
## Languages we'll implement

* Example of _Typed $\mu$Scheme_ code:

```
(val-rec  ; top-level recursive definition
  (forall (’a) ((list ’a) -> int)) ; type
  length                           ; name
  (type-lambda [’a]                ; value
    (lambda ([xs : (list ’a)])
      (if ((@ null? ’a) xs)
          0
          (+ 1 ((@ length ’a) ((@ cdr ’a) xs)))))))
```

<!-- EXTRA SECTION GOES HERE -->
## Overview of implementations

* Programming language interpreters and compilers are fairly complex programs

* However, they have a very standardized structure

* Here, we will give you an overview of this structure
---
## Overview of implementations

* A typical interpreter has these stages:

---
## Overview of implementations

* A typical interpreter has these stages:

* **Parsing**: convert concrete syntax to abstract syntax

---
## Overview of implementations

* A typical interpreter has these stages:

* **Simplification**: compile abstract syntax to simpler intermediate representation(s)

---
## Overview of implementations

* A typical interpreter has these stages:

* **Type checking**: validate static types (typed languages only)

---
## Overview of implementations

* A typical interpreter has these stages:

* **Evaluation**: compute result value, update environment(s)

---
## Parsing

* We divide parsing into two parts:
  * language-independent (conversion to S-expressions)
  * language-dependent

* Let's consider this code:

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

---
## Parsing

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

* This code is in the _concrete syntax_ of the language

* That means: it's a single (usually multiline) string

---
## Parsing

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

* Strings are hard to work with programmatically
  * too little structure!

* So we convert it into a different form

---
## Parsing: S-expressions

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

* The syntax is just a bunch of nested lists, symbols, and numbers

* This syntax is known as "S-expression" syntax

* Used in languages derived from Lisp (Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Common Lisp)
---
## Parsing: S-expressions

```
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

* The first step of parsing is to convert this into an equivalent OCaml data structure
---
## Parsing: S-expressions

* Here is the S-expression type definition:

```
type expr =
  | Int  of loc * int
  | Id   of loc * string
  | List of loc * expr list
```

* `loc` is a type for source code locations
  * used in error reporting, but otherwise uninteresting
---
## Parsing: S-expressions

* The conversion happens in two stages:
  * _Lexing_ converts the raw string form into a list of tokens
  * _Parsing_ proper converts the list of tokens into one or more `expr` values
---
## Parsing: S-expressions

* After lexing our code, we will have a list of tokens like this
  (ignoring locations):

```
[TOK_LPAREN, TOK_ID "define",
 TOK_LPAREN, TOK_ID "factorial", TOK_ID "n", TOK_RPAREN,
 TOK_LPAREN, TOK_ID "if",
 TOK_LPAREN, TOK_ID "=", TOK_ID "n", TOK_INT 0, TOK_RPAREN,
 TOK_INT 1,
 TOK_LPAREN, TOK_ID "*", TOK_ID "n",
 TOK_LPAREN, TOK_ID "factorial",
 TOK_LPAREN, TOK_ID "-", TOK_ID "n", TOK_INT 1,
 TOK_RPAREN, TOK_RPAREN, TOK_RPAREN, TOK_RPAREN, TOK_RPAREN]
```
<!-- .element class="smaller" -->

* This is the input to the parser proper
---
## Parsing: S-expressions

* After parsing our code, we will have an S-expression like this
  (ignoring locations):

```
LIST[
  ID["define"], LIST[ID["factorial"], ID["n"]],
  LIST[ID["if"], LIST[ID["="], ID["n"], INT[0]],
    INT[1],
    LIST[ID["*"], ID["n"],
      LIST[ID["factorial"], LIST[ID["-"], ID["n"], INT[1]]]
    ]]]
```
<!-- .element class="smaller" -->

* This is our first abstract representation of the `factorial` code
---
## Parsing: Language-specific

* We use S-expressions because they are easy to parse and completely general

* However, they are not suitable as input to an evaluator

---
## Parsing: Language-specific

* We need to convert the S-expression representation to a representation that is
  specific to a given language

* _That_ representation will be the input to the evaluator
  (at least for simple evaluators)

* This representation is known as an _abstract syntax tree_
  (or _AST_ for short)

---
## NOTE!

* The vast majority of "real" languages do not use S-expressions

* They go directly from concrete syntax to a language-specific AST

* Consequently, if they want to extend the language,
  they have to add to/rewrite the parser

---
## NOTE!

* With S-expression syntax:
  * we just have to add to the code that converts from S-expressions to
    language-specific AST forms
  * No changes to the concrete syntax parser are needed!
---
## Parsing: Language-specific

* Here is what language-specific AST types might look like:

```
type expr =
  | Literal of int
  | Var     of string
  | If      of expr * expr * expr
  | Lambda  of string list * expr
  | Call    of expr * expr list

type def = Define of string * expr
```

* (Actually it's more complicated than this)
---
## Parsing: Language-specific

* Here is what the `factorial` code would look like in that abstract syntax:

```
Define ("factorial",
  Lambda (["n"],
    If (Call (Var "=", [Var "n", Literal 0]),
        Literal 1,
        Call (Var "*",
          [Var "n",
           Call (Var "factorial",
                 [Call (Var "-",
                        [Var "n", Literal 1])])]))))
```

* _This_ will be the input to the language evaluator

---
## Compiling to intermediate representation (IR)

* Some (not all) of our languages will convert the AST to an intermediate
  representation (IR) before evaluation

* The goal is to simplify the language, get rid of redundant constructs, and
  make the evaluator simpler to write
  * Sometimes optimizations can also be done

---
## Compiling to intermediate representation (IR)

* Conversion to IR is the only part of the course
  that can be considered to be about "compiling"

---
## Evaluation

* The evaluator will take the AST (or IR) form(s) and one or more
  _environments_ and compute the result of evaluating the forms

* Evaluating expressions returns a value
  * may or may not change environment(s)

* Evaluating definitions always changes the environment(s)

---
## "What about compilers?"

* Compilers have a front-end which is similar/identical
  to what we've already described

* Main differences:
  * no evaluator!
  * many more steps after generation of AST
    (several successive IRs)
  * many code optimizations along the way

---
## "What about compilers?"

* Compilers usually output the final representation to a file, _e.g._
  * x86 or ARM machine code, or
  * LLVM IR, or
  * bytecode (Java, Python)

* Then it's the job of another program to actually execute the code
---
## "What about compilers?"

* Some languages (like OCaml) have multiple ways of compiling code
  * to machine code
  * to bytecode
  * to bytecode which is immediately executed<br/>
    (`ocaml` interpreter)

* There are many possibilities!
---
## "What about compilers?"

* Although compilers are interesting, our main concern is
  exploring the space of language design

* Interpreters help us understand how languages work internally

* Compilers are about optimizing code for production use

* Take CS 164 to learn about compilers!
---
## Next time

* We will start digging into the _Imp_ language
