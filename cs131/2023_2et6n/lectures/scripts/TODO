Ideas for scripts
=================

**********

An "overlay.py" script to process overlays.

Often there are multiple slides that all have the same equations or code in
them.  Instead of having to write this:

  ---
  # title

  ```
  bla bla bla
  ```

  * comment 1

  ---
  # title

  ```
  bla bla bla
  ```

  * comment 2

  ---
  # title

  ```
  bla bla bla
  ```

  * comment 3

I would like to be able to write:

  ---
  # title

  ```
  bla bla bla
  ```

  // OVERLAY
  // --> 1
  * comment 1
  // <-- 1
  // --> 2
  * comment 2
  // <-- 2
  // --> 3
  * comment 3
  // <-- 3
  // END OVERLAY

What would even be more ambitious is to allow varying the code as well (e.g. by
highlighting different sections) but that quickly leads to diminishing returns.
