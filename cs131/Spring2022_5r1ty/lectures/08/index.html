# CS 131:<br/>Programming Languages
## _Lecture 8_:<br/>The _$\mu$Scheme+_ Language

---
## Today

* The _$\mu$Scheme+_ language

* Control operators:
  * `break`, `continue` 
  * `try-catch`, `throw`
  * `return`

* Small-step semantics
* Evaluation using a context stack

---
## Overview

* We've been talking about the _$\mu$Scheme_ language

* _$\mu$Scheme_ is a fairly decent dynamically-typed mostly-functional language

---
## Overview

* However, _$\mu$Scheme_ is less successful as an imperative language
  * It's lacking certain features found in nearly all imperative languages

* Today, we'll define a new language called<br/>_$\mu$Scheme+_
  that fixes this problem

---
## Loops

* Loops are a pervasive feature of imperative programming

* In _$\mu$Scheme_, the only loop construct is `while`

---
## Loops

* A `while` loop:
  * checks to see if a test expression returns `#t`
  * If it does:
    * it executes a body expression<br/>(for side effects)
    * it re-runs the entire `while` loop
  * Otherwise, it terminates and returns a unit (`#u`) value

---
## Loops

* "Real" imperative languages have more kinds of loop statements, _e.g._
  * `do`/`while` (C)
  * `for` (C)
  * `foreach` (Python, confusingly called `for`)

* We saw how to implement some of these as syntactic sugar in assignment 1

---
## Loops

* Implementing these control flow structures as syntactic sugar
  is fun and useful, but it doesn't require any real change to the language

* It's much more complicated to implement control flow statements
  that change the course of a loop in progress

---
## Loops

* Most imperative languages support at least two of these:
  * `break` (to "break out of" a loop)
  * `continue` (to restart the loop _i.e._ skip the rest of this iteration)

---
## Loops

* `break` and `continue` may not seem very important,
  but implementing them will require a completely new approach!

* Even our operational semantics will be completely transformed

---
## Loops

* With this approach, we'll also be able to easily handle
  exception-handling constructs like `try/catch` and `throw`,
  as well as `return` to return early from a function

* We'll also be able to do useful things like _tail-call optimization_ (TCO)

---
## The trouble with `break`

* _Why_ does something as seemingly innocuous as `break`
  require us to completely change our implementation strategy?

---
## The trouble with `break`

* Our interpreters have two basic kinds of constructs:
  * _expressions_ which evaluate to a value
  * _definitions_ which extend an environment

---
## The trouble with `break`

* Since `break` occurs within `while` loops (a kind of expression),
  they have to be "expressions" too
  * (Can't have definitions inside expressions)

* What kind of value should a `break` evaluate to?
* Does this question even have meaning?

---
## The trouble with `break`

* A `break` expression isn't an _expression_ in the normal sense

* It's really a different kind of thing altogether: a _control flow operator_

---
## The trouble with `break`

* `break` changes the way a `while` loop executes

* Conceptually, it's very simple: it just forces early exit from the loop

* However, our interpreter hasn't been structured to allow us to do this

---
## The trouble with `break`

* The function which evaluates expressions is called `eval_expr`

* It takes an environment and an expression and returns a value

* But `break` doesn't return a value;
  it alters the control flow of the `while` loop it is embedded in

* The `while` loop is evaluated by a call to `eval_expr`
  further down on the call stack

---
## The trouble with `break`

* If `break` were evaluated by this function,
  it wouldn't have access to the `while` loop's evaluation,
  so it couldn't affect it

* How could we fix this?

---
## Fixing `break`

* Maybe we could have `eval_expr` return a special value
  when evaluating a `break`

* We could create a datatype for this:

<pre><code>type eval_expr_result =
  | Value of value
  | Break
</code></pre>

* Most forms would return a `Value` result, but `break` would return `Break`

* Opinions?  Good?  Bad?

---
## Fixing `break`

* One problem: we would need to extend this to deal with
  other control flow constructs.  Soon we'd have:

<pre><code>type eval_expr_result =
  | Value of value
  | Break
  | Continue
  | Throw expr
</code></pre>

---
## Fixing `break`

* Another problem is that formerly simple forms would have to deal
  with all the extra cases

* Usually they would just pass them through,
  leading to lots of boilerplate code

---
## Fixing `break`

<pre><code>    ...
    | If (l, cond, t, e) -&gt;
      <em>match (eval_expr env cond) with</em>
        <em>| Value v -&gt;</em>
          if truthy l v then
            eval_expr env t
          else
            eval_expr env e
        <em>| other -&gt; other</em>
    ...
</code></pre>

* There should be a better way...

---
## Fixing `break`

* Maybe we could raise a particular kind of exception
  for `break` and `continue`

* Opinions on this?  Good, bad, mixed?

---
## Fixing `break`

* Good:
  * Might not have to alter the code that much;
    Recursive calls that can handle `break` can simply catch that exception

---
## Fixing `break`

* Bad:
  * Heavy reliance on a meta-language feature (exception handling)
    that isn't there in all implementation languages
  * Pretty hard to express this in operational semantics


* We won't go this route

---
## Evaluation contexts

* The problem we have is that
  we have no _explicit_ representation of the _context_
  in which an evaluation occurs

* The runtime stack provides an _implicit_ representation of context,
  but this isn't good enough to express things like
  "abort this evaluation and every evaluation
  back to the first `while` expression on the stack"

* Solution: make the context explicit!

---
## Evaluation contexts

* Recall the CS 4 lecture on continuation-passing style &#9786;

* There, we showed that you can add an extra argument to a function representing
"the thing that needs the result of the computation"

* We will use a similar trick here
  * (This is a continuation-passing interpreter)

---
## Evaluation contexts

* However, the extra argument will not be a function, but a _stack_ of
  _frames_

* The top frame of the stack will represent the context of the previous
  evaluation (one up on the runtime stack)

* The next frame down represents the context of the evaluation before that,
  _etc._ all the way back to the initial expression that was evaluated

---
## Frames

* What is in these "frames"?

* A frame can be thought of as an _incompletely evaluated form_  

* The expression being evaluated is often a subexpression of a larger form

---
## Frames

* The frame consists of 
  * Every part of the larger expression that has already been evaluated
  * Every part of the larger expression that still needs to be evaluated
    (other than the current expression)

---
## Frames

* One useful way to think about frames is "expressions with holes"

* The current expression is the part of the larger expression that
  (when evaluated) will "go in the hole"
  to continue evaluating the larger expression

* Let's look at an example: the `if` expression

---
## Frames: `if` expressions

* Previously, evaluating an `if` expression<br/>`(if e1 e2 e3)` went as follows:
  * Evaluate `e1` to a value `v1`
  * If `v1` is `#f`, evaluate `e3` to get the result `v3`
  * Otherwise, evaluate `e2` to get the result `v2`

* We can write this using operational semantics notation,
  but it's basically the same thing

---
## "Big-step" semantics

* This way of describing evaluation is called "big-step" semantics

* "Big-step" means that the entire expression is reduced to a value
  in the conclusion of a particular rule or rules

---
## "Big-step" semantics

* For `if` statements, there are two rules: _IfTrue_ and _IfFalse_:
  * _IfTrue_ rule conclusion:<br/>`(if e1 e2 e3)` $\Downarrow$ `v2`
  * _IfFalse_ rule conclusion:<br/>`(if e1 e2 e3)` $\Downarrow$ `v3`

* (The store ($\sigma$) might get updated too)

---
## "Big-step" semantics

$$
\hspace{1em}
$$

$$
\frac{
\langle e_1, \rho, \sigma \rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v_1, \sigma' \rangle
\hspace{1em}
v_1 \neq BoolVal(\text{\\#f}) \hspace{1em}
\langle e_2, \rho, \sigma' \rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v_2, \sigma'' \rangle
}{
\langle IF(e_1, e_2, e_3), \rho, \sigma \rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v_2, \sigma'' \rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{IfTrue}
$$


$$
\hspace{1em}
$$

$$
\frac{
\langle e_1, \rho, \sigma \rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v_1, \sigma' \rangle
\hspace{1em}
v_1 = BoolVal(\text{\\#f})
\hspace{1em}
}{
\langle IF(e_1, e_2, e_3), \rho, \sigma \rangle
\Downarrow
\langle v_3, \sigma'' \rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{IfFalse}
$$

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* With a stack of frames (contexts) we will not use big-step semantics

* Instead, we will use "small-step" semantics
  which shows how the parts of an expression
  are evaluated step-by-step

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* In words, here is what the small-step semantics for `(if e1 e2 e3)` say:
  * Create a frame from `e2` and `e3` that has a "hole" where the value
    resulting from evaluating `e1` will go
  * Push the frame onto the context stack
  * Evaluate `e1` to get `v1`
  * Pop the context stack to get `e2` and `e3` back
  * If `v1` is `#f`, evaluate `e3`
  * Otherwise, evaluate `e2`

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* Here is what the math version looks like:

$$
\frac{
}{
\langle
IF(e_1, e_2, e_3), \rho, \sigma, S
\rangle
\rightarrow
\langle
e_1, \rho, \sigma, IF(\bullet, e2, e3) :: S
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{SmallStepIf}
$$

* Here, $S$ is the stack of contexts

* It may not actually be a list, but we treat it as if it were one
  (hence the use of the $::$ operator to push a new frame onto the stack)

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* Here is what the math version looks like:

$$
\frac{
}{
\langle
IF(e_1, e_2, e_3), \rho, \sigma, S
\rangle
\rightarrow
\langle
e_1, \rho, \sigma, IF(\bullet, e2, e3) :: S
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{SmallStepIf}
$$

* The "`if` frame" is $IF(\bullet, e2, e3)$

* The $\bullet$ is the "hole", which is the place where the value of `e1` will
  eventually go

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* There are two more small-step reduction rules:

$$
\frac{
v \neq BoolVal(\text{\\#f})
}{
\langle
v, \rho, \sigma, IF(\bullet, e2, e3) :: S
\rangle
\rightarrow
\langle
e_2, \rho, \sigma, S
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{SmallStepIfTrue}
$$

$$
\frac{
v = BoolVal(\text{\\#f})
}{
\langle
v, \rho, \sigma, IF(\bullet, e2, e3) :: S
\rangle
\rightarrow
\langle
e_3, \rho, \sigma, S
\rangle
}
$$

$$
\label{}\tag{SmallStepIfFalse}
$$

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* In words:
  * If the result of the test isn't `#f`,<br/>
    pop the frame stack and start evaluating $e_2$
  * If the result of the test is `#f`,<br/>
    pop the frame stack and start evaluating $e_3$

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* The `if` evaluation rules are divided up into 
  * a rule for evaluating the test expression
  * two rules for evaluating either the "then" expression or the "else"
    expression, depending on the value of the test expression

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* The small-step semantics is clearly more "granular"
  than the big-step semantics

* However, we haven't really gained anything
  by switching to small-step semantics in this case

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* For other forms (like `break` and `continue`),
  the small-step semantics will give a precise description
  of exactly what has to happen when those forms execute
  * (and there is no big-step counterpart of these semantics)

---
## "Small-step" semantics

* We will go over these semantics in detail in the next lecture

* For now, we'll give a description of the `break` semantics

---
## "Small-step" semantics: `break`

* In words, here is what `break` does:
  * `break` is supposed to occur only inside a `while` loop
  * There is a kind of frame called _WHILE_RUNNING_BODY_ which occurs when a
    `while` loop is executing

---
## "Small-step" semantics: `break`

* In words, here is what `break` does:
  * If the _WHILE_RUNNING_BODY_ frame is at the top of the context stack
    when `break` occurs,
    pop it off the stack and the `while` evaluates to `#u`
  * If the top of the context stack represents returning from a function call,
    it's an error
  * Otherwise, pop the top of the context stack and continue evaluating
    `break`<br/>(this is called _unwinding the stack_)

---
## "Small-step" semantics: `break`

* _N.B._ Unwinding the stack is the key thing that `break` does
  that couldn't be done before

---
## "Small-step" semantics: `break`

* The stack continues to unwind until one of these happens:
  * it gets to a _WHILE_RUNNING_BODY_ frame (which terminates the `break`)
  * an error occurs
  * it pops all frames off the stack (which is also an error)

* This gives us the semantics for `break`<br/>that we want

---
## Aside: Relation to compilers

* This approach to writing interpreters is _not_
  what most actual programming language interpreters do

* However, it _is_ found in a lot of compilers,
  notably compilers for functional languages

---
## Aside: Relation to compilers

* A common approach to compiling functional languages
  is to convert the entire program into continuation-passing style,
  which yields very simplified code

* Then this code can be either interpreted or converted to assembly language

---
## Aside: Relation to compilers

* Reference: <u>Compiling With Continuations</u> by Andrew Appel

---
## Next time

* Hopefully, this gave you a flavor of how<br/>_$\mu$Scheme+_ evaluates

* Next time, we'll walk through
  the operational semantics of _$\mu$Scheme+_ in detail
