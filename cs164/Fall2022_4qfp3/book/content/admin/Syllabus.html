<h1>Syllabus<a class="headerlink" href="#syllabus" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This is a tentative syllabus for CS 164 (Compilers), Fall 2022.
Everything is subject to revision.</p>

<div class="section" id="course-description">
<h2>Course description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This course covers the construction of <em>compilers</em>: programs which convert
program source code to machine code which is directly executable on modern
hardware.  The course takes an incremental approach: a series of compilers will
be built, all of which generate assembly language code for x86-64 processors,
with each compiler adding features to the previous one. The final compiler will
compile programs written in a full-fledged high-level programming language to
assembly language, which can then be compiled to machine language using
standard tools.</p>
<p>Topics covered include register allocation, conditionals, loops and dataflow
analysis, garbage collection, lexical scoping, and type checking.</p>
<p>This course is project-based and programming-intensive.  Students will work in
teams of two students each.
All compilers will be written in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> programming language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">
<h2>Learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-objectives" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>At the end of this course, you will have written a compiler from a small subset
of a typed dialect of the Scheme programming language to assembly language.
Along the way, you will learn the primary ingredients of modern compilers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The course has a hard prerequisite of CS 4 (Fundamentals of Computer
Programming), because you need to know OCaml to take this course.</p>
<p>Two recommended (but not required) prerequisites are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CS 24 (Introduction to Computing Systems), primarily because we will be using
assembly language, and CS 24 includes an introduction to assembly language.
However, we will describe all the assembly language instructions we need
as we get to them.</p></li>
<li><p>CS 131 (Programming Languages).  This course is useful because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>CS 131 also uses OCaml, so students who have taken it have
experience writing moderately large multi-file programs in OCaml;</p></li>
<li><p>students who have taken CS 131 already know what an abstract syntax
tree (AST) is, and what intermediate representations (IRs) are,
which will be useful.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, though, we will cover this material in this course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook<a class="headerlink" href="#textbook" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The course textbook is <em>Essentials of Compilation</em> by Jeremy Siek. This is a
freely-available textbook available as a PDF. We will be following the book
quite closely. The main difference is that the book uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>
programming language to build the compilers, whereas we will use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>.</p>
<p>The PDF of the textbook we will use is available on the course Canvas site,
under Modules/Resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topics-covered">
<h2>Topics covered<a class="headerlink" href="#topics-covered" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is a very abbreviated list of topics covered in the course,
presented in the order it will be covered.
Some additional material may be covered towards the end of the course.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<div class="section" id="grading-scheme">
<h2>Grading scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-scheme" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The course is on grades.  There are no exams.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There are 6 homeworks, each given a numerical grade from 0-100.
They are collectively worth 75% of the course grade.</p></li>
<li><p>20% for participation in weekly code reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>5% for participation in class.
Lecture slides will be posted after class, but lectures will not be recorded.</p></li>

<p>Assignments will be due on Fridays at 2 AM.  (This is effectively very late
Thursday night.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-assignments">
<h3>Writing assignments<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-assignments" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Assignments are done in teams of two students each.  Teams will stay together
for the duration of the term (unless one student drops the course or unless
there is some serious problem).  Teams are expected to split the workload of
each assignment evenly, and there may be penalties if it is obvious that one
student in the team is doing most or all of the work.</p>
<p>Students will create a <strong>private</strong> Github repository for their code. They will
add the course instructor as a full contributor to their repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="submitting-assignments-and-receiving-grades">
<h3>Submitting assignments and receiving grades<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-assignments-and-receiving-grades" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Since the instructor will have access to the code repositories of the teams, he
can check out the latest version of the code and run the tests at any time.
Thus, assignments do not need to be “submitted” as such; instead, “submitting”
an assignment means that the team lets the instructor know when an assignment
is ready to be graded (ideally, before the due date/time).</p>
<p>The instructor will grade the assignment and leave comments in a file at the
root of the directory called GRADES.  He will also usually leave comments in
the code regarding code that students need to fix/change. Such comments will
have this form:</p>
<div class="highlight-ocaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">(*** REWORK TODO: ... ***)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We ask that you do not use this style for your own comments.
Once the items have been fixed, such comments should be removed before
“resubmitting” the assignment.</p>
<p>If students do not understand a comment, they are encouraged to contact the
instructor for clarification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-reviews">
<h3>Code reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#code-reviews" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once a week, teams will meet with the instructor online for roughly a half hour
code review session.  These sessions (which will normally happen on Thursday or
Friday) are open-ended; they can be used for anything the instructor or the
students want.  We expect that students will discuss problems they are having
with their assignments, points of confusion, or just ask the instructor if a
particular piece of code is written the right way.  Conversely, the instructor
may ask students why they chose to write a particular piece of code a
particular way, and may suggest alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redos">
<h3>Redos<a class="headerlink" href="#redos" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There is a two-tier assignment redo policy.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Once grades have been submitted, teams have one week from that time to
rework the assignment for up to full credit. These are called “primary
redos”.</p></li>
<li><p>After that period, teams can still request redos at any time.  These are
called “secondary redos”.  Whether those redos are graded, or graded
promptly, depends on the workload of the instructor.  If/when they are
graded, any additional points are worth only half credit.
Students can request multiple secondary redos, but the instructor
may not grade them (or may grade them very late) if he is short on time.
The instructor will try hard to be available to grade at least one
secondary rework per assignment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Example: team A does assignment X and gets 75/100.  They submit a (primary)
rework one week later, it is graded, and the new grade is 90/100 (they got 15
more points at full credit).  Then, two weeks later, they submit a secondary
rework, and their code has no flaws (it would have been 100/100 if this were
the original submission or the primary rework).  However, they only get half
credit for the additional 10 points, so their final grade is 95/100.
This cannot be changed with further reworks, as there is nothing left to fix.</p>
<p>The goal of the rework system is to encourage you to get the code completely
right without putting an undue grading burden on the instructor.  Thus, try to
make sure that your code passes all the test before submitting a rework!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="late-policies">
<h3>Late policies<a class="headerlink" href="#late-policies" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Because the instructor has access to your code repositories, and thus can run
the tests on those repositories at any time, in principle there is no need for
a late policy (any assignment can be graded simply by running the tests at any
time).  However, a team can request that an assignment be graded later than the
usual time.</p>
<p>Teams get 10 “late days” for the entire term.  A “late day” can be used to
defer grading without penalty.  Once late days are up, if a team still wants
grading of an assignment to be deferred, they have two choices:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>allow the incomplete assignment to be graded</p></li>
<li><p>request further late days, with late penalties</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A late penalty is 10% of the final (unpenalized) grade per day late.  It cannot
be redeemed through rework.</p>
<p>Example: team A has used up all its late days, and wants another late day for
assignment X.  They submit the assignment one day late, get 80/100, and two
reworks to eventually get 100/100.  Because of the late day, their final grade
for the assignment is 90/100 (losing 10 points for the late day).</p>
