<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The CS 164 collaboration policies determine if, and how much, you are allowed
to collaborate with other students while working on your assignments.</p>
<p>Please read this document to the very end, because you are responsible for
abiding by all the rules set forth here.  Failure to abide by these rules may
cause you to get sent to the Board of Control, and that is not pleasant for
anyone concerned.  Therefore, we want to be extra clear on what constitutes
fair collaboration in this course.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In some places in this document, you will read that some kind of behavior is
<em>strictly forbidden</em>.  We are not trying to scare you or intimidate you, and
we’re not trying to be jerks.  We just want to make absolutely sure that you
know what the rules are, and saying that something is <em>strictly forbidden</em> is
pretty unambiguous.  (We apologize in advance if you find this annoying.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-policy">
<h2>Basic policy<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-policy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As this course is a partnership course, you are expected to collaborate 100%
with your partner.
You can discuss anything related to the assignments with them,
share code with them (obviously), ask each other questions, <em>etc.</em>
<strong>Nothing is off-limits collaboration-wise as long as it’s with your partner.</strong>
Everything else that is described below refers to “collaboration”-style
activities with people who are <em>not</em> your partner.
When we refer to “you” below we mean the collective “you” <em>i.e.</em> your team.</p>
<p>You are welcome to collaborate informally on your assignments with other
students who are taking or have taken the class, but you <em>must</em> write all of
your own code and you <em>must not</em> look at code from other groups. Copying
another group’s code verbatim or nearly verbatim (from a file, a whiteboard, a
screen share or anywhere else) is not acceptable and is an Honor Code
violation. Taking another group’s file and modifying it to make it look
different is <em>definitely</em> not acceptable and is an Honor Code violation.
Consulting a printed or electronically displayed version of another group’s
code and referring to it while you write your own code is not acceptable
either, and is also an Honor Code violation. Having someone not in your group
dictate code while you type isn’t acceptable either.  Basically, your group has
to do your own work.</p>
<p>Getting advice on algorithms or syntactic details of the language, or
suggestions on how to debug a part of your program that isn’t working, is fine
as long as no code sharing is involved.</p>
<p>All of the above also applies to student work from previous years. Copying code
from an assignment that was submitted in previous years <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a> is an Honor Code
violation just as much as copying from a group who are currently taking the
course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-and-abuse-of-pseudocode">
<h2>Use and abuse of pseudocode<a class="headerlink" href="#use-and-abuse-of-pseudocode" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In the past, some students have been called in to the BoC because of very
similar code that was ultimately traced to pseudocode written on a whiteboard
which was almost exactly like the final code.  Pseudocode is supposed to be an
<em>informal</em>, <em>non-executable</em> description of an algorithm.  If you write or
consult pseudocode which is (say) 80% or more of the way to being actual
runnable code as a way to do an end run around the collaboration policies, be
advised that we and the BoC are well aware of this problem and you will not get
away with it.  On the other hand, if you (or a TA) write out or read pseudocode
which is a human-readable description of an algorithm without any actual code
in it, you are fine.  If in doubt, ask the instructor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teleconferencing-software-eg-zoom">
<h2>Teleconferencing software (<em>e.g.</em> Zoom)<a class="headerlink" href="#teleconferencing-software-eg-zoom" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you use teleconferencing software (like Zoom) or software with
teleconferencing capabilities (like Discord with VOIP), you <em>may not</em> share
your screen with students from another group, whether to help them or to get
help from them.  This also applies to non-students (with the obvious exception
of the course instructor or TAs).</p>
<p>Also, it is <em>strictly forbidden</em> to dictate code over teleconferencing
software, except (obviously) with your partner.  This is consistent with the
rules in the other sections of this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discussion-boards-and-chat-programs">
<h2>Discussion boards and chat programs<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-boards-and-chat-programs" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You are <em>strictly forbidden</em> from posting code from your assignments to a
discussion board (such as Piazza) unless it’s a private message to one or more
instructors/TAs.  If this happens you may lose the ability to use the
discussion board for any purpose.  On the other hand, if you post a private
message you can include your partner in the message (if Piazza allows this).</p>
<p>This also applies to programs with chat features that are not used in the
course (like Slack or Discord), or email for that matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-of-websites">
<h2>Use of websites<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-websites" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Your code repository must be and remain <em>private</em>.  Do not allow outsiders to
see your code, even after the course is finished.  Public repos can quickly
make the assignments worthless.</p>
<p>In the event that a student from a previous year makes their repo public,
please inform the instructor, and, of course, you aren’t allowed to
consult this code.</p>

<h2>Consequences for violating these policies<a class="headerlink" href="#consequences-for-violating-these-policies" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>

from another student, and can get you into just as much trouble.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the course collaboration policies, please
contact the instructor. Do not ask the teaching assistants; they may not give
you the best answer.</p>
<p>We realize that the vast majority of you (hopefully <em>all</em> of you) have no
intention of cheating or overcollaboration in any way, and we hope that this
collaboration policy won’t get in the way of your enjoyment of the course.</p>
