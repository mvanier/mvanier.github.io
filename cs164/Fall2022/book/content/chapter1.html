<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Welcome to CS 1!  We’re delighted that you’re taking our course.  We hope you
have a lot of fun and learn a lot in the process.</p>
<p>This book serves as the official course notes, so that lectures are less of a
brain dump of details and more an opportunity to interactively go through code
examples, answer questions, and get you thinking about the programming process.
You should ideally have read the relevant book chapter(s) before coming to
lecture, so you can use class time to ask questions about the material and
refine your understanding.  We will use the questions you ask in the lecture to
improve the book.</p>
<div class="section" id="topics">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span>Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#topics" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This chapter is a general introduction to programming and Python followed by a
short crash course on the most basic aspects of Python, which will be continued
in the next chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-programming-background">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.2. </span>Your programming background<a class="headerlink" href="#your-programming-background" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We are very well aware that students in CS 1 come from a very wide variety of
backgrounds in terms of knowledge of computer programming.  Some of you have
never programmed a computer before.  That’s fine, you’re in the right place!
Others have some or perhaps even extensive programming experience.  We will try
to make these notes accessible to everyone, and if there is a topic that you
are very familiar with, we encourage you to skim (but not to skip) the notes on
that topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="programming-as-a-thought-process">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.3. </span>Programming as a thought process<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-as-a-thought-process" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>[This section is for new programmers; experienced programmers can skip to the
next section.]</p>
<p>The hardest subjects to learn are usually those that force you to think in a
different way than you’re used to.  When you learn algebra, you have to
generalize the arithmetic you’ve learned (“ten apples times three equals thirty
apples”) to allow for unknown quantities (variables) (“<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> apples times <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code>
equals <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xy</span></code> apples”).  That’s a mental leap.  When you learn calculus you have
to generalize what you know about functions to allow for operations like
derivatives that take functions as arguments.  And when you learn programming
for the first time, you have to learn to “think like a machine”.  This is what
we mean when we speak of programming as a thought process.  Thinking like a
machine means understanding enough about how the computer works to be able to
predict what the result of executing your code is going to be.</p>
<p>Thinking like a machine isn’t necessarily hard, but it is <em>different</em>.  The
machine (the computer) works by iron-clad rules of logic, doing many very
simple operations at blinding speed.  We write programs to tell computers what
to do, and the computer will do <em>exactly</em> what we tell it to, no more and no
less, whether it makes sense or not.  There is no room for error; if you get a
single character wrong in your program, it will either do the wrong thing or
not run at all.  The computer doesn’t know or care what you “meant” it to do,
only what you specifically <em>asked</em> it to do.  It is completely literal and
completely unforgiving.  You should expect to spend a lot of time fixing
mistakes in your programs (which are called “bugs”) to finally get it to do the
right thing.  Fortunately, the computer has a number of safeguards which
prevent you from doing anything really horrible (so running a program is
unlikely to physically destroy the computer itself, for instance); usually if
you make a mistake it will just complain that something went wrong and halt, or
else it’ll just not do what you wanted it to.</p>
<p>Learning to understand the very logical, very exact, very literal and
incredibly picky way a computer works is going to take time.  We’re not going
to lie to you: programming can be incredibly frustrating.  But once you finally
get it to do what you want, it’s also incredibly satisfying, and with
experience, the less frustrating it gets and the more satisfying it is.  (But
the frustration never goes away entirely!)  We will be trying to help you learn
to “think like a machine” all through this course.  Often, we will not give you
the whole story about what is happening when we first introduce a topic,
because to do that would take too long and be tedious.  But as we visit and
revisit topics, we will fill in more and more of the gaps so that eventually
you’ll have a very good idea of what happens when your programs execute.  (To
get a <em>really</em> deep understanding of all this, though, you’ll have to take more
courses than just CS 1!)  Don’t worry; it’s going to be fun!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="program-design-as-a-thought-process">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.4. </span>Program design as a thought process<a class="headerlink" href="#program-design-as-a-thought-process" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>[This section is for beginning and experienced programmers alike.]</p>
<p>Even after you internalize the first thought process (thinking like a machine)
you have to learn another thought process: how to <em>design</em> programs.  You will
have to write many functions and programs in this course.  You’ll be given a
pretty precise description of what the function or program is supposed to do,
and then you will have to write the code to do it.  This is a creative act!
There is always going to be more than one way to solve all but the simplest
problems, and there is never going to be an objectively “perfect” answer.  But
for many programmers, even ones who understand the workings of a programming
language quite well, it can be challenging to put together the elements of the
programming language in the right way to solve a problem.  We call this
activity <em>program design</em>.  As a creative act, we can’t give exact rules on how
to do it, but we <em>can</em> give guidelines, rules of thumb, and general wisdom that
we and other programmers have accumulated over our programming careers. Knowing
these guidelines and rules of thumb should help you when you have to write a
function but don’t know where to start.</p>
<p>The details of the programming language we’ll be teaching you (Python) will be
in this book.  The thought process behind program design will mainly be covered
in lectures, often by simply showing you a problem and walking through the
steps needed to solve it.  That way, you’ll see how experienced programmers
think about a problem, and you can apply what you learn to your own programs.</p>

<div class="section" id="programming-jargon">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.5. </span>Programming jargon<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-jargon" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Another challenge for beginning programmers is that programming uses a lot of
common words with very specific meanings that aren’t the usual meanings.  Words
like “list”, “dictionary”, “string”, “files”, “function”, “interpreter” and so
on mean very different things when used in a programming context than they
would mean in everyday conversation.  We will try very hard to be incredibly
clear on what a particular programming term means, especially if that meaning
is different from the common meaning.  If you find a term confusing, let us
know so we can improve this book!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-choice-of-programming-language">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.6. </span>The choice of programming language<a class="headerlink" href="#the-choice-of-programming-language" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We will be using the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language exclusively in this course.
Python is both an excellent first programming language, useful for teaching the
basic concepts of programming, as well as an incredibly useful real-world
language.  Perhaps most relevant to you, Python has in recent years emerged as
one of the most important programming languages in science and data analysis,
as well as one of the most-used languages in machine learning and artificial
intelligence.  Python is easy to learn, incredibly versatile, very readable,
and very consistent.  You may know some (or a lot!) of Python already, but even
in that case we’re pretty sure we’re going to be teaching you some new things
about it. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id7" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>We love Python both as a teaching language and as a language we use ourselves,
but don’t kid yourself: it’s not the only good or useful programming language.
If you take CS 2, you will learn Java; if you take CS 3 and/or CS 11, you will
learn C and maybe also C++, and if you take CS 4 you will learn OCaml.  Serious
programmers need to know more than one language, so think of this as the start
of your programming journey.  Programming is a lot of fun, and we hope to show
you why we love it so much and why it’s so exciting to learn computer science.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-brief-history-of-python">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.7. </span>A brief history of Python<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history-of-python" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Computer languages have weird names.  Some, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code>, are completely
arbitrary and meaningless. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id2">2</a> Others, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Java</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ruby</span></code>, are named
after something (coffee and the gem stone).  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Python</span></code> is named after the
British comedy group <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus">Monty Python’s Flying Circus</a>.
It was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer who
wanted a language that was easier to use than C for everyday tasks.  Guido was
also a fan of the comedy group, so he named his language after them as an
homage.</p>
<p>Python has been under continual development ever since it was created, and the
latest version of Python available as of this writing is Python 3.10.2.
Python is now one of the most popular programming languages in use today.</p>
<p>The Python web site is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>.  It’s good to bookmark it, because
the Python documentation is hosted there, and you will definitely need it for
this course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-examples">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.8. </span>Code examples<a class="headerlink" href="#code-examples" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In the supporting documents we will be going through all the details you need
to know in order to get Python working on your computer, which IDE/editor to
use <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id9" id="id3">3</a>, <em>etc.</em>  We won’t do that in this book, but instead we’ll assume you
can run Python code.  If you can’t do that yet, don’t worry; you should still
be able to understand the code examples.  (You simply won’t be able to run them
yourselves yet.)  However, we strongly recommend that you do get Python set up
as soon as possible and follow along with the readings by typing in the
examples and playing around with them; you’ll learn a lot more that way and
it’ll be more fun too.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet of Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello, world!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Believe it or not, this is a complete Python program!  When run from a terminal
window, it will print the words <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hello,</span> <span class="pre">world!</span></code> to the terminal. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id10" id="id4">4</a></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A “terminal” (more jargon!) is a program which allows you to directly type
commands to your computer.  Some of you may never have used a terminal, because
non-programmers typically have little use for one.  Programmers use them all
the time, and some of us spend most of our time on the computer working inside
a terminal.  Terminal programs include <em>Terminal.app</em> and <em>Iterm.app</em> (MacOS),
<em>Windows Terminal</em> (Windows), and many different programs for Linux.  You can
run Python programs directly from a terminal, and we’ll show you lots of
examples of this.</p>
</div>
<p>We will get into the details of Python below, but just so you aren’t confused:
the words <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'Hello,</span> <span class="pre">world!'</span></code> in single quotes are a Python <em>string</em> (which is
the way textual data is represented inside Python).  The word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> stands
for a built-in Python <em>function</em> which takes a single <em>argument</em> (in this case
the string <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'Hello,</span> <span class="pre">world!'</span></code>) and prints it out to the terminal. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id11" id="id5">5</a> We’ll
talk more about functions in the next chapter, and we’ll cover strings in
detail after that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-code-files-vs-the-interactive-interpreter">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Source code files <em>vs.</em> the interactive interpreter<a class="headerlink" href="#source-code-files-vs-the-interactive-interpreter" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In this course, we will be working with Python in two distinct ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>interactively, using the Python “interactive interpreter”</p></li>
<li><p>running code from files</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you are writing your assignments, you will be using Python in both ways
(though probably more the second than the first).  When we are giving lectures,
we will use the interactive interpreter extensively, but we’ll also often write
code in a file and run it.  Sometimes we’ll do it both ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-code-files">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Source code files<a class="headerlink" href="#source-code-files" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Python code that you write (using an editor) is called <em>source code</em>.  The
“source” word implies that this is the first thing that is created in order to
make a program.  “Files” are just data that is stored on a computer permanently
<em>i.e.</em> they don’t disappear when the computer is turned off.  Python source code
files are plain text files with a specific suffix, which is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code>. Usually,
the name of a source code file is in all lowercase letters; for instance, you
might have one called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lab1.py</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudoku.py</span></code>.</p>
<p>Let’s say we’ve written a file of Python code called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello.py</span></code> which contains
the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello, world!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can run this file by typing the following command at a terminal <em>command
line</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python hello.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> is called a <em>prompt</em>; you don’t type it.  (Your prompt may look
different than this.) Inside a terminal there is a program called a “shell”
which is running, and the shell is the program which interprets commands like
this.  The shell prompt (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> above) is printed automatically when the
shell is waiting for more input.  Then you type in the words <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span>
<span class="pre">hello.py</span></code> and hit the Return key (or the Enter key on some keyboards).  What
this does is run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> program (which is the program that runs Python
language files) on the file called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello.py</span></code>.</p>
<p>If all goes well, the terminal should print out:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Hello, world!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and return you to the prompt.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This assumes your computer is running either Linux or Mac OS X as its operating
system.  If it’s running Windows, you can get to a terminal prompt like this by
installing the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>,
but don’t worry about this for now; there are other ways to run
Python programs on Windows.  The important thing to understand is that you can
run all the Python code in a single file with a single command.</p>
</div>
<p>Python programs can be split between multiple files; such files are usually
called “modules”.  We’ll talk more about modules in a future chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-python-interpreter">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.4. </span>The Python interpreter<a class="headerlink" href="#the-python-interpreter" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>It’s also possible to enter all the code for a program on-the-fly by starting
up the Python interpreter.  An “interpreter” or “interactive interpreter” is a
program which reads lines of code you type and immediately runs them.  Python
can work as an interpreter if you run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> program in the terminal
with no arguments.</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will cause the interactive Python interpreter to start up.  You’ll know
that’s happened when you see the Python <em>prompt</em>, which looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The prompt is how Python tells you it’s waiting for you to type a line of code
for it to execute.  (Don’t confuse the Python prompt with the shell prompt; the
Python prompt is only used to enter Python language statements, not to invoke
arbitrary programs.)  Now you can enter expressions at the prompt:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Hit Return (or Enter), and Python will helpfully print out:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and print out the prompt again.  If you want to exit the interpreter, type
“control d” <em>i.e.</em> hold down the “control” key on your keyboard while typing the
letter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d</span></code> (lowercase).  This will exit the interpreter and return you to the
shell prompt.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>So we don’t have to write “Return (or Enter)” over and over,
we’ll always refer to the key that enters a line of text as
the Return key from now on.</p>
</div>
<p>It’s important to understand that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code> prompt is <em>not</em> part of the Python
language; it’s just the way that the interactive Python interpreter lets you
know that it is waiting for you to enter some code.</p>
<p>There is more to say about the interactive interpreter; we will cover it as we
get to it.</p>

<p>One thing that is easy to do with Python is to use it as a kind of
terminal-based calculator program.  You do this by starting the interactive
interpreter and entering arithmetic expressions:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="go">4</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mf">1.2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mf">3.4</span>
<span class="go">4.08</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">16</span>
<span class="go">65536</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">12</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="go">0.16666666666666666</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and so on.  Note that some common operations use different operators than is
customary in math:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default" id="id13">
<caption><span class="caption-text">Operators</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id13" title="Permalink to this table"></a></caption>
<colgroup>

<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code></p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code></p></td>
<td><p>to the power of</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is done because common symbols like the “times” symbol (<span class="raw-html">&times;</span>)
and the “divide” symbol (<span class="raw-html">&divide;</span>) can’t be typed on a standard
keyboard.  (Most programming languages use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code> for multiplication
and division.) Traditional math notation uses superscripts for powers, which is
also not easily typeable, so Python uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code>.  So <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">**</span> <span class="pre">16</span></code> means “2 to
the power of 16”.</p>

<div class="section" id="numbers">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.5.2. </span>Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#numbers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Numbers in Python can be “integers” (no fractional part) or “floating point”
(approximate real numbers).  Floating point numbers are a computer
approximation to real numbers. Some real numbers (like <span class="raw-html">&pi;</span> or <em>e</em>)
need an infinite number of decimal places to represent them exactly.  Computers
don’t have infinite storage, so the number is cut off after a certain number of
decimal places, and we call this kind of number a “floating point” number (or
“float” for short).</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">42</span>
<span class="go">42</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mf">1.23</span>
<span class="go">1.23</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mf">6.022e23</span>
<span class="go">6.022e+23</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">42</span></code> is an integer, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.23</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6.022e23</span></code> are floating point numbers.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span></code> means “exponent”, so <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6.022e23</span></code> means 6.022 <span class="raw-html">&times;</span>
10 <sup>23</sup>. You can combine integers and floating-point numbers in arithmetic
expressions:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">42</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mf">1.23</span>
<span class="go">43.23</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Python even lets you use complex numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mf">2.3</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3.4</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mf">4.5</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(-6.949999999999999+12.32j)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(Don’t worry if you don’t yet know what complex numbers are.) <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id6">6</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="operator-precedence">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.5.3. </span>Operator precedence<a class="headerlink" href="#operator-precedence" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When writing arithmetic expressions with different operators, sometimes there
will be two reasonable ways to interpret the expression.  For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>could mean either</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The usual rule in math is to do multiplications (and divisions) before additions
(and subtractions), so in fact Python evaluates this the first way:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="go">7</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you really want to evaluate it the second way, add the parentheses yourself:</p>
<div class="highlight-pycon notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="go">9</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In computer-language-speak, we say that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> operator has a higher
<em>precedence</em> than the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> operator.  There are a lot of precedence rules in
Python (and in most programming languages), but you don’t generally have to
think about them; things usually do what you expect.  Most of the time, all you
need to remember is that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code> are higher precedence than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code> is higher precedence than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code> (assignment, next section) is lower than any of them</p></li>
<li><p>use parentheses if you need to force a different order of evaluation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you positively have to know what the relative precedences of different
operators are, you should look at the Python language <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence">precedence table</a>.
