Course description
------------------

This course covers the construction of *compilers*: programs which convert
program source code to machine code which is directly executable on modern
hardware.  The course takes an incremental approach: a series of compilers will
be built, all of which generate assembly language code for x86-64 processors,
with each compiler adding features to the previous one. The final compiler will
compile programs written in a full-fledged high-level programming language to
assembly language, which can then be compiled to machine language using
standard tools.

Topics covered include register allocation, conditionals, loops and dataflow
analysis, garbage collection, lexical scoping, and type checking.

This course is project-based and programming-intensive.  Students will work in
teams of two students each.
All compilers will be written in the OCaml_ programming language.


Learning objectives
-------------------

At the end of this course, you will have written a compiler from a small subset
of a typed dialect of the Scheme programming language to assembly language.
Along the way, you will learn the primary ingredients of modern compilers.


Prerequisites
-------------

The course has a hard prerequisite of CS 4 (Fundamentals of Computer
Programming), because you need to know OCaml to take this course.

Two recommended (but not required) prerequisites are:

* CS 24 (Introduction to Computing Systems), primarily because we will be using
  assembly language, and CS 24 includes an introduction to assembly language.
  However, we will describe all the assembly language instructions we need
  as we get to them.

* CS 131 (Programming Languages).  This course is useful because:

  * CS 131 also uses OCaml, so students who have taken it have
    experience writing moderately large multi-file programs in OCaml;

  * students who have taken CS 131 already know what an abstract syntax
    tree (AST) is, and what intermediate representations (IRs) are,
    which will be useful.

  Again, though, we will cover this material in this course.


Textbook
--------

The course textbook is *Essentials of Compilation* by Jeremy Siek. This is a
freely-available textbook available as a PDF. We will be following the book
quite closely. The main difference is that the book uses the Racket_
programming language to build the compilers, whereas we will use OCaml_.

The PDF of the textbook we will use is available on the course Canvas site,
under Modules/Resources.


Topics covered
--------------

This is a very abbreviated list of topics covered in the course,
presented in the order it will be covered.
Some additional material may be covered towards the end of the course.

* Overview of the compilation process
* Variables and scoping
* Register allocation and graph coloring algorithms
* Conditionals and type checking
* Loops and dataflow analysis
* Tuples and garbage collection
* Functions
* Lexically-scoped functions (time permitting)


Grading scheme
--------------

The course is on grades.  There are no exams.

* There are 6 homeworks, each given a numerical grade from 0-100.
  They are collectively worth 75% of the course grade.

* 20% for participation in weekly code reviews.

* 5% for participation in class.
  Lecture slides will be posted after class, but lectures will not be recorded.

Letter grades are assigned as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Numerical grade (out of 100%)
     - Letter grade
   * - 95-100%
     - A+
   * - 90-95%
     - A
   * - 85-90%
     - A-
   * - 80-85%
     - B+
   * - 75-80%
     - B

     - D
   * - < 55%
     - F


Lectures
--------

Lectures will be held MWF from 11 AM to noon in Annenberg room 104.

Most weeks will only have MW lectures, with the F lecture slot being
used for code reviews.


Assignments
-----------


Assignment due dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assignments will be due on Fridays at 2 AM.  (This is effectively very late
Thursday night.)


Writing assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assignments are done in teams of two students each.  Teams will stay together
for the duration of the term (unless one student drops the course or unless
there is some serious problem).  Teams are expected to split the workload of
each assignment evenly, and there may be penalties if it is obvious that one
student in the team is doing most or all of the work.

Students will create a **private** Github repository for their code. They will
add the course instructor as a full contributor to their repository.


Submitting assignments and receiving grades
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since the instructor will have access to the code repositories of the teams, he
can check out the latest version of the code and run the tests at any time.
Thus, assignments do not need to be "submitted" as such; instead, "submitting"
an assignment means that the team lets the instructor know when an assignment
is ready to be graded (ideally, before the due date/time).

The instructor will grade the assignment and leave comments in a file at the
root of the directory called GRADES.  He will also usually leave comments in
the code regarding code that students need to fix/change. Such comments will
have this form:

.. code-block:: ocaml

   (*** REWORK TODO: ... ***)

We ask that you do not use this style for your own comments.
Once the items have been fixed, such comments should be removed before
"resubmitting" the assignment.

If students do not understand a comment, they are encouraged to contact the
instructor for clarification.


Code reviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a week, teams will meet with the instructor online for roughly a half hour
code review session.  These sessions (which will normally happen on Thursday or
Friday) are open-ended; they can be used for anything the instructor or the
students want.  We expect that students will discuss problems they are having
with their assignments, points of confusion, or just ask the instructor if a
particular piece of code is written the right way.  Conversely, the instructor
may ask students why they chose to write a particular piece of code a
particular way, and may suggest alternatives.


Redos
^^^^^

There is a two-tier assignment redo policy.

#. Once grades have been submitted, teams have one week from that time to
   rework the assignment for up to full credit. These are called "primary
   redos".

#. After that period, teams can still request redos at any time.  These are
   called "secondary redos".  Whether those redos are graded, or graded
   promptly, depends on the workload of the instructor.  If/when they are
   graded, any additional points are worth only half credit.
   Students can request multiple secondary redos, but the instructor
   may not grade them (or may grade them very late) if he is short on time.
   The instructor will try hard to be available to grade at least one 
   secondary rework per assignment.

Example: team A does assignment X and gets 75/100.  They submit a (primary)
rework one week later, it is graded, and the new grade is 90/100 (they got 15
more points at full credit).  Then, two weeks later, they submit a secondary
rework, and their code has no flaws (it would have been 100/100 if this were
the original submission or the primary rework).  However, they only get half
credit for the additional 10 points, so their final grade is 95/100.
This cannot be changed with further reworks, as there is nothing left to fix.

The goal of the rework system is to encourage you to get the code completely
right without putting an undue grading burden on the instructor.  Thus, try to
make sure that your code passes all the test before submitting a rework!


Late policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because the instructor has access to your code repositories, and thus can run
the tests on those repositories at any time, in principle there is no need for
a late policy (any assignment can be graded simply by running the tests at any
time).  However, a team can request that an assignment be graded later than the
usual time.

Teams get 10 "late days" for the entire term.  A "late day" can be used to
defer grading without penalty.  Once late days are up, if a team still wants
grading of an assignment to be deferred, they have two choices:

#. allow the incomplete assignment to be graded
#. request further late days, with late penalties

A late penalty is 10% of the final (unpenalized) grade per day late.  It cannot
be redeemed through rework.

Example: team A has used up all its late days, and wants another late day for
assignment X.  They submit the assignment one day late, get 80/100, and two
reworks to eventually get 100/100.  Because of the late day, their final grade
for the assignment is 90/100 (losing 10 points for the late day).


External websites
-----------------

There will be a course Piazza page and a Discord server (to be set up).

Piazza is more appropriate for more involved questions, whereas Discord is for
quick questions and also will be used for office hours and code reviews.
Code reviews may also be done on Zoom (at the discretion of the instructor).


Course software
---------------

Setting up the course software is described in
:doc:`assignment 0 </content/assignments/0/Assignment0>`.


Academic integrity
------------------

Caltechâ€™s Honor Code states that: *"No member of the Caltech community shall
take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community."*

**Understanding and avoiding plagiarism**: Plagiarism is the appropriation of
another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate
credit, and it violates the honor code in a fundamental way. You can find more
information at: http://writing.caltech.edu/resources/plagiarism.


Collaboration policies
----------------------

Collaboration policies are given in :doc:`Collaboration_policies`.


Diversity and inclusion
-----------------------

You all belong in this class and as such should expect to be treated with
respect by your classmates and by the course staff. It is our goal, as the
course staff, to provide an interesting and challenging environment that is
conducive to learning. If any incident occurs that challenges this commitment
to a supportive and inclusive environment, please let the instructor know so
the issue can be addressed.

Accessibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We consider accessibility to be an extremely important issue.  If some aspect
of the course is making it more difficult for you to learn the material, we
want to hear about it!  We want this course to be an enjoyable experience for
you, not a burden.

Student wellness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is very important to us that you take care of your mental wellness
throughout the course. Everyone on the course staff is available to chat, and
you can always attend office hours for a non-academic conversation if
necessary.

Students with documented disabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a
disability must initiate the request with Caltech Accessibility Services for
Students (CASS).  Professional staff will evaluate the request with required
documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an
Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the
request is being made. Students should contact CASS as soon as possible, since
timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. http://cass.caltech.edu/.

Undergraduate students should contact Dr. Lesley Nye, associate Dean of
Undergraduate Students and graduate students should contact R. Darrell
Peterson, Associate Dean of Graduate Studies.
